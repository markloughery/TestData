          3  a witness named in the above stipulation,

          4  was examined and testified as follows:

          5            BY MR. BALHOFF:

          6                  Good afternoon, Mr.

          7            Dempster.  Thank you for coming

          8            for your deposition this

          9            afternoon.  I know you've given

         10            your deposition a couple of times

         11            before.  Basically, all these

         12            attorneys are going to get a

         13            chance to ask you some questions.

         14            If you don't understand any of

         15            our questions, please let us know

         16            and we can ask the question in a

         17            better way.

         18            BY THE WITNESS:

         19                   I will.

         20            BY MR. BALHOFF:

         21                   If you can also wait until

         22            the person asking the question

         23            asks his question before you

         24            answer it, that will make it

         25            clearer for the court reporter.

          7                  That's fine.

          9                  If you answer any of the

         10            questions that we ask, we will

         11            assume that you understood the

         12            question that we asked.  Is that

         13            fine?

         14            BY THE WITNESS:

          1      Q.    How long have you been on Social

          2  Security?

          3      A.    I got on Social Security in March

          4  of 2005.

          5      Q.    Where were you working before

          6  that?

          7      A.    I was working for Turner

          8  Industries.  I was working at Vulcan

          9  Chemical in Gonzales, Louisiana.

         10      Q.    How long were you at Turner -- at

         11  Vulcan for Turner?

         12            BY MR. WILSON:

         13                  Objection.  Aren't we going

         14            to be talking about someone else?

         15            BY MR. BALHOFF:

         16                   We are.  This is the

         17            furthest one I'm going to go

         18            back, or the latest one I'm going

         19            to go into.  I'm just curious

         20            where he's been last.

         21            BY THE WITNESS:

         22                  I just started recently

         23            working for Turner because our

         24            company turned -- they took over.

         25            I was working for Basic out of

          2            years.

          3  EXAMINATION BY MR. BALHOFF:

          4      Q.    I will just say for the record

          5  that we are under court orders or

          6  recommendations from a special master in

          7  this case, in the Walker case, that we are

          8  not to go into areas that have already been

          9  covered in your previous depositions.

         10            BY MR. BALHOFF:

         11                  Off the record.

         12             (OFF-RECORD DISCUSSION)

         13            BY MS. ROUSSEL:

         14                   Quote, if the witness has

         15            no knowledge of the employment

         16            history or exposure to asbestos

         17            products of a particular

         18            plaintiff and has previously been

         19            deposed about all products

         20            implicated in this case, that

         21            deposition should not be taken,

         22            period, closed quotes.

         23                  We have similar rulings in

         24            the Danos case.  The trial judge

         25            stated that if the witness states

          1            he does not know Golzie Danos,

          2            that should end the inquiry.  A

          3            writ was taken to the Fourth

          4            Circuit, and the Fourth Circuit

          5            granted the writ in part and

          6            stated questioning of the witness

          7            will be restricted to areas not

          8            previously covered in other

          9            depositions.

         10                  In all other respects, this

         11            writ application is denied

         12            because the trial court had

         13            indicated that if Golzie Danos

         14            was known, then the witness could

         15            be deposed with regard to

         16            specific questions with regard to

         17            Mr. Danos.

         18                   I did want to state that.

         19            In Fremin, we also had -- we took

         20            a writ in that case to Fourth

         21            Circuit, and the Fourth Circuit

         22            specifically stated that Johnny

         23            Johnson and Meredith would apply.

          1  of your previous depositions, you had

          2  indicated that several crafts at Avondale

          3  had worked around each other.  The crafts

          4  that you had mentioned were pipe fitters,

          5  insulators, electricians, painters, and

          6  other finishing work?

          7      A.    Right.

          8      Q.    Did all those crafts work around

          9  each other at Avondale?

         10      A.    Yeah.  On the ship, you had all

         11  kind of craft, whatever it took -- people

         12  to do the job.  They also had welders.

         13  They had those -- They called them

         14  shrinkers.  They shrink the bulkheads on

         15  the boat.  It was a number of different

         16  craft on the ship at one time, yes.

         17      Q.    Did the insulators such as

         18  yourself work around electricians?

         19      A.    Yes, at times or another we did.

         20      Q.    You also identified in the

         21  Dufrene case some ships you worked on --

         22  around Steve Dufrene.  I just want to make

         23  sure whether there were any other types of

         24  ships that you worked on at Avondale.  The

         25  types of vessels that you identified were

          1  Navy ships?

          2      A.    Right.

          3      Q.    DE's?

          4      A.    DE's.  They had a lot of hospital

          5  ships we did some repairing.  We did some

          6  cargo ships, the Lykes line.

          7      Q.    Coast Guard cutters?

          8      A.    Coast Guard cutters, that's

          9  right.

         10      Q.    Mine sweepers?

         11      A.    Yes.

         12      Q.    Any other types of vessels you

         13  worked on at Avondale?

         14      A.    Like I said, most of the -- you

         15  know, the new ones were like all the Navy

         16  ships we worked seven years on.  Navy ships

         17  -- They built Navy ships about seven years.

         18  I basically stayed on them ships for a long

         19  time.

         20      Q.    Are there any other naval vessels

         21  bedsides the DE's, mine sweepers, Coast

         22  Guard cutters that you classify as Navy

         23  vessels?

         24      A.    Right, and the hospital ship,

         25  which was we repaired on it.  We had a lot

          1  of -- We worked -- The cargo ship was the

          2  Lykes line.  That was a brand new ship.

          3  They also had a lot of repairing, depending

          4  on where they put you at.  In other words,

          5  depend where they put you at.  You move

          6  around, do a lot of work.  It was mostly

          7  ships on the water.

          8      Q.    I left one out.  You also worked

          9  on barges at Avondale too; is that correct?

         10      A.    Yes, we did.  We sure did.

         11      Q.    On all these types of vessels

         12  that you worked on at Avondale, were

         13  insulators also working around electricians

         14  on these vessels?

         15      A.    Yes.  We worked around everybody.

         16  Like I said, at times or another we were

         17  around electricians, pipe fitters, welders.

         18  All crafts had something to do on them

         19  ships.

          1            Mr. Dempster has a personal

          2            situation where he would like to

          3            get out of here as quickly as

          4            possible.  We apologize for not

          5            getting you on the phone at the

          7            about five minutes just talking

          8            about the types of vessels Mr.

          9            Dempster worked on at Avondale.

         14                  Objection.  Previous

         15            depositions, aren't they covered

         16            by this -- these orders?

         17            BY MR. BALHOFF:

         18                  It's a bridge question.

         19            BY MS. ROUSSEL:

         20                  It didn't sound like a

         21            bridge question.  The last four

         22            questions weren't bridge

         23            questions.

          2            the type of naval vessels he

          3            worked on related to this case

          4            and not to the Steve Dufrene

          5            case.  At this time, I will be

          6            getting into certain insulating

          7            materials that he identified in

          8            his previous depositions.  I will

          9            ask him about those materials as

         10            they relate to these three cases.

         12                  Okay.  Now, let me indicate

         13            for the record that he does not

         14            know any one of these plaintiffs.

         15            He's talked about the products

         16            that he recalls in his -- in

         17            these other depositions.  You've

         18            already asked him did

         19            electricians work around

         20            insulators, and he said from time

         21            to time they would.

         22                  I'm going to object to any

         23            additional questions being asked

         24            about the products when he

         25            doesn't know these three

         14  asbestos blankets as being used at

         15  Avondale, correct?

         16      A.    Right.

         17      Q.    Would those have been used around

         18  electricians?

         19      A.    We sure do.

         20      Q.    About those asbestos blankets,

         21  you had stated that they were sewed

         22  together in the insulator shop at Avondale?

         23      A.    Right.

         24      Q.    Were those ever sewed together

         25  onboard the vessels?

          1      A.    Yes.  At time or another we had

          2  to do some -- readjust them, you know.  You

          3  might have to cut for something, so you had

          4  to resew them by hand.

          4  what you were saying?

          5      A.    We didn't really sew the blankets

          6  on the ship.  What I was telling you, if

          7  you had to justify for a hanger or a pipe

          8  or something, we did cut them and sew them

          9  back up so it would fit.  Most of your

         10  blanket was fabricated in the shop.

         11            You can't fabricate something and

         12  bring it on the ship and take it that it's

         13  going to fit.  You got all kind of stuff.

         14  Welders put hangers in the way and stuff

         15  like that.  You got to cut them so they

         16  will fit.  There were some cutting on the

         17  ship also.

         18      Q.    When you are talking about the

         19  asbestos blankets, is this the same as --

         20  You'd also talked in your previous

         21  depositions about an asbestos cloth.  Are

         22  these asbestos blankets the same or

         23  different from asbestos cloths?

         24      A.    Same.  Everything was asbestos.

         25  The cloth was asbestos.  The material

          1  inside the blanket was asbestos.  The

          2  sewing thread was asbestos.  The only

          3  thing, they had a couple of stainless steel

          4  wires.  The coating on the thread was

          5  asbestos.

          6            At the time, we didn't know what

          7  it was, you know.  We knew it was asbestos.

          8  As far as we knew, it couldn't affect us.

          9  We worked with it like, you know, nothing

         10  going on.  Just down the years after we

         11  found out how bad it was for you.

         12      Q.    When you cut the asbestos

         13  blankets or the asbestos cloth, would it

         14  create dust?

         15      A.    Oh, yeah, it sure did.

         16      Q.    Would this dust have been created

         17  around electricians?

         18      A.    If they were around us, yes, it

         19  would have been created around them.

         20      Q.    Were there any particular vessels

         21  that we have talked about previously that

         22  you did not use asbestos blankets for?

         23      A.    I don't believe.  Every ship that

         24  had an engine room, they had asbestos in

         25  it.  On the engine, your piping, all your

          1  pipe was asbestos.  I don't believe they

          2  had a ship out there that didn't have

          3  asbestos.

          4      Q.    Are you telling me that asbestos

          5  blankets were used aboard every type of

          6  these ships you worked on?

          7      A.    Asbestos blankets, and you had

          8  your pipe coverings was asbestos.

          9  Everything we put on there, even the pipe

         10  covers came back over with asbestos cloth

         11  and glued it and wrapped the pipes.

         12      Q.    That was the next product we were

         13  going to talk about, was the pipe covering.

         14      A.    That was in the engine room, the

         15  fire room, any room they had engines like

         16  generators, exhaust generators and all that

         17  and you had people in there.  You had

         18  electricians in there, the cleanup people,

         19  the pipe fitters, the welders.  At times we

         20  was bunched up in one room.

         21            If we were exposed to it,

         22  everybody around you was getting the same

         23  thing.  We were on top of each other at

         24  times.  There might have been days we were

         25  by ourselves in there, but the majority of

          1  time, everybody worked in the same room.

          2  Everybody had a job to do.

          3      Q.    Correct me if I'm wrong, but I

          4  believe the pipe covering, either

          5  manufacturers or trade names that you had

          6  identified in your previous depositions,

          7  were Kaylo, Johns-Manville.

         14      Q.    Let me ask you this.  Can you

         15  think of any products that you identified

         16  in your previous depositions that you did

         17  not work around electricians while using --

         18      A.    That would be a hard question to

         19  answer.  Like I said, we were -- they had

         20  people working out there.  I don't know if

         21  this guy was a electrician or not.  I knew

         22  my fellow workers, if he was an insulator.

         23  I had friends out there, pipe fitters,

         24  welders.  As far as these people they're

         25  talking about, I don't know them.  I can't

          1  tell you if it was a electrician, if he was

          2  a pipe fitter.

          3            We was doing our job, just

          4  basically doing our job, and everybody was

          5  just like working the same area.  Like I

          6  said, I can't swear to you and say yeah,

          7  there was a electrician right here while I

          8  was doing this.  There probably was an

          9  electrician.

         10            But I know I worked in areas

         11  where the electricians were pulling the

         12  cables through the trays and all that.  You

         13  had your pipe fitters welding pipes.  You

         14  had a bunch of different craft working in

         15  the same area.  Now, who they was -- Like

         16  some of them come up with a name and said

         17  was he there at that time.  No, I can't do

         18  that.  We worked -- Everybody worked in the

         19  same group.

         20            A ship is not just one room like

         21  this.  It's big.  You go all over the

         22  place.  They did have electricians.  They

         23  had pipe fitters.  They had welders, you

         24  know.  Everybody worked -- They wouldn't

         25  let us go insulate, and then when we

          1  finished our job, another craft would come

          2  in.  It wasn't like that.  Everybody worked

          3  in the same area.  Like I said, you know, I

          4  know at times they had electricians there.

          5  I would be lying to you if I told you they

          6  didn't, like they had other crafts.

          7      Q.    In light of what you just said, I

          8  think I would just like to briefly go down

          9  the products that you had talked about.

         10  Would electricians have worked around the

         11  pipe coverings you have identified as

         12  working with aboard vessels being

         13  constructed at Avondale?

         14      A.    If they worked around us?

         15      Q.    Would electricians have worked

         16  around you while you were using these types

         17  of pipe coverings?

         18      A.    Yeah, they would have.

         19      Q.    Did cutting these types of pipe

         20  covering create dust?

         21      A.    Yes, it did, because everything

         22  was dry.  We cut it with those big pruning

         23  saws, and they created a lot of dust.  It

         24  wasn't just the insulation dust in there.

         25  You had welders that created smoke.  It was

          1  -- It would.

          2      Q.    Mr. Dempster, you had also

          3  identified -- Are there any vessels that we

          4  talked about previously that you did not

          5  use these types of pipe covering aboard?

          6      A.    No, not at that time.

          7      Q.    Let's move on to the next one.

          8  You had identified a cement or mud.  One of

          9  the names you knew was One Shot.

         10      A.    One Shot.

         11      Q.    Did you use One Shot mud around

         12  electricians?

         13      A.    There again, it's possible it

         14  could have happened.  Like I say, I don't

         15  remember specifically if they had

         16  electricians by me when I was doing it.

         17  They had a bunch of people.  Like I told

         18  you before the first question, it's

         19  possible it happened, you know.

         20            The electricians, they ran their

         21  wires everywhere.  If I was in the engine

         22  room working on the pipes around the

         23  boilers and all, you had electricians there

         24  hooking up wires and all that.  You had

         25  pipe fitters, there again.  You had

          2            When they build these ships,

          3  everybody was in one area, a different

          4  area.  But what I'm saying, different

          5  crafts was always in the same area.  It

          6  wasn't like one craft was in one area at

          7  one time and the rest would stay out.  We

          8  walked on top of each other at times.  It

          9  was congested, a lot of people.

         10      Q.    Are there any types of vessels

         11  that you previously identified that you

         12  cannot recall using the One Shot cement or

         13  mud?

         14      A.    You probably did -- some part of

         15  the ship you did.  One Shot mud was

         16  basically used where your boiler workers

         17  at, in other words, in your engine room.

         18      Q.    Was there a type of ship that we

         19  identified that you didn't use that mud

         20  aboard?

         21      A.    No.  Like I said, every ship

         22  since I been there nine years, almost ten

         23  years, every ship we had, that's the type

         24  of insulation we used.

         25      Q.    Did -- Once the One Shot mud or

          1  cement was dried, did it create dust?

          2      A.    Not if you didn't disturb it.  If

          3  you go beating on it, break it up, if you

          4  tear into it once it settled, it's dry,

          5  it's like anything else.  Then they put the

          6  finishing coat on it, that cloth and

          7  everything else, and it was sealed, not

          8  sealed 100 percent.  Unless you disturb it,

          9  you had to tear into it to do something,

         10  then it would create dust.

         11      Q.    Was there ever a need to tear

         12  into it?

         13      A.    Well, yeah.  That's what I told

         14  you.  We did some repairing on a lot of

         15  ships.  A lot of times you might have to go

         16  strip something down, like I said, maybe

         17  for electricians or welders.  You had to go

         18  there till your work is done.  Not

         19  everything we put up stayed all the time.

         20  Some of it stayed permanent, but some of it

         21  we had to go tear into to find something.

         22            I don't know if you understand

         23  me.  Like a hanger for a pipe, they might

         24  hang another pipe underneath, so you had to

         25  cut into the insulation for the pipe fitter

          1  to put a hanger or something like that, so

          2  you disturbed that stuff.

          3            A lot of people walk on that mud

          4  you are talking about.  That happened more

          5  than one time.  We do the finish job, and

          6  people be walking to go do their work and

          7  all that stuff is just being brittle and

          8  just crumbling and falling.

          9      Q.    Was the need to tear into or

         10  disturb the cement or mud a daily job?

         11      A.    If we done it daily?

         12      Q.    Did you have to tear into the mud

         13  on a daily basis?

         14      A.    No, I wouldn't say daily, no.

         15      Q.    How often?

         16      A.    I couldn't answer you that

         17  question.  I really wouldn't know.

         18      Q.    You had also said that you worked

         19  with mastics aboard vessels constructed at

         20  Avondale.  One particular name that you

         21  recognized was Foster?

         17                   Neither of the two

         18            previous depositions involved

         19            electricians.  Steve Dufrene was

         20            an insulator helper.  Joyce

         21            Dempster was the wife of an

          1            but he said from time to time he

          2            would work around electricians.

          3            He's already indicated that he

          4            doesn't know any of these three

          5            gentlemen.

         15      Q.    But the questions in Dufrene were

         16  also specifically targeted to Steve

         17  Dufrene, certainly not targeted to

         18  electricians.  So, again, my question is

         19  whether, Mr. Dempster, you as an insulator

         20  worked with mastics aboard vessels

         21  constructed at Avondale around

         22  electricians?

         23      A.    Let me put it to you this way.

         24  If I tell you yeah, I could be lying to

         25  you.  If I tell you no, I could be lying to

          1  you again.  I don't know specifically if

          2  they had electricians around.  Like I told

          3  you, we had people, different crafts

          4  working around us.  You can ask me until

          5  tomorrow if I worked around electricians.

          6  I can't answer you.  I don't know.

          7            I did work with electricians on

          8  the ship.  I worked with pipe fitters.  I

          9  worked with welders.  I worked with those

         10  shrinkers.  I worked with even the

         11  laborers.  We were all in the same place.

         12  I'm not going to tell you yeah, I worked

         13  with electricians.  But, we did work, yeah,

         14  with electricians.  I told you that

         15  already.  They'd be pulling wires through

         16  them cable trays.  They'd be hooking up the

         17  lights, whatever the work was.

         18            I was familiar with my job.  At

         19  that time that is what I was doing, my job.

         20  We were out there doing the job.  Like I

         21  said, you know, they did have electricians

         22  at the time.  Now, if I worked with that

         23  mastic or if I worked with them blankets or

         24  whatever, probably did.  Forty years ago,

         25  it's kind of hard to tell you yes, I

          1  remember that electrician when I was

          2  putting that blanket on.  I would be lying

          3  to you.  I don't know.

          4            But I'm sure at one time or

          5  another, they was there.  It wasn't just

          6  insulators in the room.  Like in the engine

          7  rooms, we had all crafts.  Any craft that

          8  Avondale took to build the ship was working

          9  in them rooms.  At one time or another

         10  everybody was by each other.  What was we

         11  doing?  Putting blanket, putting mud, or

         12  what we were doing, I couldn't tell you

         13  that.  When we're insulating, we was

         14  fooling with asbestos.  I could tell you

         15  that much.

         16      Q.    Again, Mr. Dempster, if you don't

         17  remember a particular item, that's fine.

         18  Say you don't remember.  That's why I'm

         19  going down the list.  You remembered some

         20  of these other things.  I want to just make

         21  sure what you do remember working around

         22  electricians -- working with around

         23  electricians and what you don't remember

         24  working with around electricians.  This is

          1  1974 at Avondale.  Okay?

          2            So, is it safe to say at some

          3  point during your career from 1965 to 1974

          4  at Avondale you did use mastic around

          5  electricians?

          6      A.    I would say so.

          7      Q.    Let's move on to the cloth that

          8  was used to wrap around pipes and boilers.

          9  You had identified a thicker white or beige

         10  cloth and then some --

         18                  I need a clarification here

         19            because he identified what he

         20            talked about as an asbestos

         21            blanket as a thicker white or

         22            beige cloth, and then there were

          2            misinterpreting.  He said green,

          4            cloth.  So, either you are

         15  as thicker and white or beige?

         16      A.    They had four or five different

         17  kind of cloths.  You had the thick weave

         18  cloth that was used for blankets for the

         19  hotter part of the job.  They had different

         20  kind of cloth.  They had the blue stripe

         21  cloth, the green stripe cloth, and the red

         22  stripe cloth.

         23            And then we had another kind of

         24  cloth that was re-wettable.  You dip it in

          2  the white mastic on it and sealed it off.

          3      Q.    So, were all those different

          4  types of cloths used around electricians as

          5  well?

          6      A.    Yes, they did.  They used it

          7  around all crafts.

          8      Q.    All these products that we've

          9  been talking about, did they contain

         10  asbestos?

         11      A.    The cloth and all that?  You

         12  asked me about the cloth and the asbestos

         13  and the mastic and all that?

         14      Q.    Yes.

         23      A.    That didn't have asbestos.

         24      Q.    Okay.  Did you ever use Limp It?

         25      A.    What's that?

          1      Q.    Did you ever use a product called

          2  Limp It?

          3      A.    I don't remember.

          4      Q.    Did you ever see electricians

          5  work around Hopeman Brothers?

          6      A.    Yes.

          7      Q.    Did -- Would Hopeman Brothers

          8  employees ever cut wallboard?

          9      A.    They used to cut metal boards.

         10  They used to insulate themselves also, put

         11  Fiberglas and use sheet metal.  That's what

         12  Hopeman Brothers mostly did, metal

         13  fiberglass on the walls.  That I remember,

         14  my knowledge, that I remember them doing.

         15      Q.    Do you remember then whether

         16  Hopeman Brothers employees ever cut any

         17  type of wall material that generated dust?

         18      A.    I don't know.  I couldn't really

         19  tell you.  It's been so long.  I really

         20  couldn't tell you.

         21      Q.    Did you work with the mastics

         22  aboard all the types of vessels that we

          2  EXAMINATION BY MR. BALHOFF:

          3      Q.    Mr. Dempster, did you use mastics

          4  aboard all the types of vessels that we

          5  talked about?

          6      A.    I worked on the ship I told you

          7  about at times or another.  I might not

          8  have used mastics on one ship.  I might

          9  have been strictly insulating pipe

         10  covering.  I really can't tell you.  It's

         11  been so long ago.  Maybe I did, maybe I

         12  didn't.

         13      Q.    We are just --

         14      A.    You are talking forty-something

         15  years ago.  I'm trying to tell you the best

         16  of my knowledge what I remember.

         17      Q.    So, you can't -- Is there any

         18  particular type of vessel that you can

         19  specifically recall that you didn't use

         20  mastics aboard?

         21      A.    No, not really.

         22      Q.    Is there any specific type of

         23  vessel you can recall where you didn't use

         24  the green stripe, red stripe, blue stripe,

         25  or re-wettable asbestos cloth?

          1      A.    No.  Because at that time, they

          2  had a night crew that would come on.  We

          3  would insulate during the day.  They had a

          4  night crew that would come on and use all

          5  that cloth and wrap the pipe.  That was the

          6  finishing work on the pipe in the engine

          7  rooms and all that, the ductwork.

          8            They insulated air conditioning

          9  duct.  They used some of that cloth to wrap

         10  it with.  That was the finishing work.  I

         11  would say at one time or another, all them

         12  ships had it.  That's what we used to use

         13  every day.

         14      Q.    Do you know anything about the

         15  electrical wire and cable that was used

         16  during the construction of vessels at

         17  Avondale?

         19                  Let me object to the

         20            broadness of the question.  He's

         21            already talked about some things

         22            about the wiring and cable.  He

         23            talked about them pulling it and

         24            using it.  So, when you say "do

         25            you know anything," what are you

          2  EXAMINATION BY MR. BALHOFF:

          3      Q.    Do you know whether the

          4  electrical wire and cable that was used at

          5  Avondale contained asbestos?

          6      A.    I don't know nothing about it.

          7      Q.    Can you -- Do you know the

          8  manufacturers of any of the wire and cable

          9  used at Avondale?

         10      A.    No.

         11      Q.    Can you describe how the wire and

         12  cable used at Avondale looked?

         13      A.    Some of the wire, the smaller

         14  wire, had that -- I don't know if it was

         15  stainless.  They had the wire mesh around

         16  it.  Some had black coating around it, that

         17  I can remember.

         18            Because like I said, we insulated

         19  the -- we used to insulate the bulkheads

         20  and all that.  We used to insulate all

         21  around the electrical tracing, so we were

         22  in that part also.  Now, what they were

         23  made out of, what was the name of it, I

         24  really couldn't tell you.

         25            But I remember some of them, like

          1  I said, had the little wire casing on it.

          2  Some of them had the -- They were black,

          3  rubber coating, whatever it was.  I thought

          4  it was rubber coating.  If it was something

          5  else, I have no idea.  I have no knowledge

          6  on the electrical wires, but I know they

          7  were there.

          8      Q.    Have you ever heard of a company

         20  meet with your own attorney, did you do

         21  anything to prepare for your deposition

         22  today?

         23      A.    No.

          1      A.    No.  I didn't bring that with me.

          2  I got it at the house, though, but no, I

          3  didn't bring it.

          4            In fact, I just come back from

          5  the hospital, like I was telling him right

          6  there.  I drove up about 2:15 or something

          7  like that.  I been to the hospital since

          8  8:00 with my wife at the emergency room.  I

          9  didn't know if I was going to make this.  I

         10  tried calling your office in New Orleans,

         11  and all I got was a secretary that couldn't

         12  contact somebody -- try to get me

         13  somebody's phone.

         14            I called around 12:00.  All I got

         15  was the beeper answer.  She tried to put me

         16  to his secretary, and I couldn't get

         17  through to her.  I was trying to call him.

         18  We had miscommunication.  He had called me

         19  at a unknown listed number.  I couldn't get

         20  hold of him.  I didn't know if I could make

         21  it, so it just -- I made it right before

         22  ya'll.

         23      Q.    Did you talk to Ms. Roussel right

         24  here before this deposition?

         25      A.    Yes, I did.

          1      Q.    What did you talk about?

          2      A.    We just -- She was just showing

          3  me -- telling me -- asked me if I knew

          4  those clients, I guess electricians or

          5  whatever.  I don't know them.  The only one

          6  I knew was Steve years ago, Steve Dufrene.

          7  I knew of him real good.  She asked me if I

          8  knew Luther's wife, Luther Dempster's wife.

          9  I didn't know her.  I knew Luther.  He was

         10  my supervisor.  She asked me if I knew

         11  these guys.  I said no, sure don't, which I

         12  don't.

         13      Q.    Did you talk about anything else

         14  other than these three workers?

         15      A.    Not that I know of, not really.

         16  I just told them about when I came in and

         17  all.  No.

         18      Q.    Mr. Dempster, is there anything

         19  that you feel you need to change about your

         20  testimony from your previous depositions as

         21  we sit here today?

         22      A.    No.  As I told you, a few years

         23  back, as I remember it right now, that's

         24  it.  Some things I do remember.  A lot of

         25  things, I don't know.  As far as the

          2  out of, what it looked like.  As far as the

          3  names, I don't remember all that.  Some of

          2      Q.    You were asked some questions

          3  about mastics.  Would you agree that there

          4  were some mastics that did not contain

          5  asbestos?

          6      A.    I really couldn't tell you.  I

          7  wasn't the expert on that.  I remember we

          8  used it.  I remember we used a black

          9  mastic, and I told that when I first came

         10  in.  I don't remember the name, what it

         11  was.  It came in a five-gallon bucket.  We

         12  used to call it black mammy.  It was the

         13  nickname for it.

         14            We all sat in 55-gallon drums

         15  when we did those barges, which I forgot he

         16  asked me earlier.  We used to put that on

         17  the insulation on them barges.  The mastic,

         18  they had white mastic.  They had two

         19  different kind of white mastic.  It had a

         20  strong odor to it, and it was like --

         21  almost turned to rubber when you would

         22  finish with it.

         23            Like I said, what was in it, what

         24  was the product made out of, I couldn't

         25  tell you.  As far as the mud, the asbestos

          1  and all that, that I remember that.  But

          2  like I said, at the time we didn't know

          3  what it was.  As far as I'm concerned, it

          4  was insulation like I'm doing right now.

          6  nothing.

         21      Q.    Mr. Dempster, when was the first

         22  time somebody asked you if you knew Golzie

          1      Q.    Did anybody call and ask you, do

          2  you know Golzie Danos?

          3      A.    No, ma'am.

          4      Q.    Did anybody call and ask you, do

          5  you know Rudy Walker?

          6      A.    No, ma'am.

          7      Q.    Do you have any idea why Ms.

          8  Roussel listed you as a witness, since you

          9  don't know either of those two people?

         10      A.    I have no idea.

         11      Q.    Do you remember the name of any

         12  electricians that you did work with at

         13  Avondale?

         14      A.    Not right off the bat.  I don't

         15  even know are they guys, women, these

         16  people, or are they my age.  That was my

         17  question.  Me and my wife, she was

         18  questioning me, why are you getting

         19  subpoenaed.  I said I don't know the

         20  people.

         21      Q.    Nobody showed you any pictures?

         22      A.    No, ma'am.  When I read it on my

         23  subpoena when the cops read it to me,

         24  that's when I opened it up and read -- it

         25  didn't ring a bell.

          4      Q.    Mr. Dempster, I represent a few

          5  individuals in this lawsuit.  Do you have

          6  any testimony whatsoever regarding the

          7  responsibilities of a gentleman named Pete

          8  Territo as it relates to either Golzie

          9  Danos or Rudy Walker?

         13            executive officer issues in his

         14            first two depositions.  It's

         15            overly broad, and he does have

         16            much information which he's

         17            talked about in his prior

         18            depositions.

          8  individual named Al Bossier, correct?

          9      A.    Al Bossier?

         10      Q.    Correct.

         11      A.    You talking about the guy in

         12  charge of Avondale?  Is that the same

         13  gentleman we're talking about?

         14      Q.    I'm asking you if you have any

         15  reason to change any of your testimony that

         16  you previously gave about that individual?

         17      A.    I don't believe I was questioned

         18  about Al Bossier, was I?

         19      Q.    You would have no testimony

         20  regarding responsibilities towards safety

         21  that Al Bossier may have had or not have

         22  had towards Golzie Danos or Rudy Walker,

         23  correct?

         24      A.    I don't know who you are talking

         25  about, so no.

          1      A.    Yes, ma'am.  I seen them hook up

          2  the electrical boxes.  Every craft I seen

          3  people doing something.  If it was a pipe

          4  fitter, I seen them welding and putting

          5  pipe together.  If it was the welders, I

          6  seen them welding.  I didn't know

          7  specifically who was doing it.  Yes, like I

          8  said, we all worked in the same area.

          9      Q.    Did you see the electricians

         10  stripping their cable?

         11      A.    Yes, ma'am.  I seen that around.

         12      Q.    You saw them stripping that with

         13  knives?

         14      A.    Yes, ma'am.

         15      Q.    Did you see them cutting cable?

         16      A.    I seen them cut them.

         17      Q.    Did you see -- The cable that you

         18  saw, did you see some as big as three and a

         19  half or four inches?

         20      A.    They had all kind of size cable

         21  out there.

         22      Q.    The bigger cables, did they have

         23  to cut those with band saws?

         24      A.    I don't know if it was band saws.

          1  cutters for the smaller ones.

          2      Q.    You said that products would be

          3  on the floor.  Were these remnants or

          4  pieces of the electrical cable that were

          5  stripped off or cut off laying on the

          6  floor?

          7      A.    I imagine they would.  Just like

          8  all workmen, we cut pipe and all that.  We

          9  insulate.  We had stuff on the floor. I

         10  would imagine the stripping would be on the

         11  floor.

         12      Q.    The remnants from these products,

         13  they would be walked on by employees during

         14  the day?

         15      A.    Yes, ma'am.  Just like our

         16  material, they walk on your good material

         17  if you won't get it out of the way.

         18      Q.    When you were asked about

         19  Okonite, you are not saying the

         20  electricians didn't use Okonite?  It's just

         21  because you didn't handle those products,

         22  you don't remember who manufactured them?

          1      Q.    You don't remember one way or the

          2  other?

          3      A.    No, ma'am,

          4      Q.    Same thing with Rockbestos, you

          5  don't remember one way or the other?

          6      A.    No, ma'am.

          8                  That's all I have.  Thank

          9            you.

         10            BY MS. PARKINSON:

         11                   I have one.  It's Erin.

         12  EXAMINATION BY MS. PARKINSON:

         13      Q.    Mr. Dempster, did you ever work

         14  at a facility called American Cyanamid?

         15      A.    Yes, ma'am.

         16      Q.    Can you tell me what time frame

         17  that you worked at American Cyanamid?

         18      A.    Right offhand, I couldn't.

         19            BY MR. WILSON:

         20                  Objection.  That's back to

         21            his stuff.  That's back to his

         22            work history, et cetera, that we

         23            already -- It's been covered.

          3                  Mr. Dempster is not listed

          4            as a witness.

          6                  This is noticed in the

          7            Fremin case.

          8            BY MS. ROUSSEL:

          9                  Are you going to try to add

         10            him as a witness in the Fremin

         11            case when he doesn't know Fremin?

         12            BY MR. BALHOFF:

         13                  I'm not.  Erin has a right

         14            to ask about it.  It can lead to

         15            discoverable evidence.

         19                  Gerolyn, did you list this

         20            witness in Fremin?

         21            BY MS. ROUSSEL:

         22                  He's not listed in Fremin,

         23            since my superceding witness

         24            list.

          1                   Is he listed on anybody's

          2            witness list in the Fremin

          3            matter?

          4            BY MS. ROUSSEL:

          5                  Since the superceding

          6            witness list, I don't think that

          7            he is.  He's definitely not on

          8            mine.

         10                   John, is he on yours or

         11            Rockbestos?

         12            BY MR. BALHOFF:

         13                  He might be on mine.

         18                  Gerolyn is telling me he's

         19            not, but I honestly can't

         20            remember.

         23            responsibility for his witness

         11            information available.  He's not

         12            on my list.  You are telling me

         13            he's not on your list.  Are you

         14            calling him in Fremin to offer

         15            any testimony against American

          4                  Given no one has responded,

          5            I'm going to assume that no

          6            counsel representing any party to

          7            this litigation is calling this

          8            man to offer any testimony

          9            against American Cyanamid.  For

         10            that reason, I'll not ask him any

         20  rooms that you were in while you were at

          2            I forgot to pick up.

          3  EXAMINATION BY MR. BALHOFF:

          4      Q.    I need you to clarify something

          5  for me from one of your previous

          6  depositions.

          7            BY MR. ACCARDO:

          8                  John.  I'm sorry.  Can I

          9            just interrupt?  I'm just

         10            checking out your witness list.

         11            It looks like he is listed as a

         12            witness in the Okonite will-call

         13            list.

         17                  Yes.  It's Witness No. 49.

         18            BY MR. BALHOFF:

         19                  I thought that's why I

         20            noticed him in this case.

         22                  Then, Erin, I guess you had

          8      Q.    Mr. Dempster, can you tell me

          9  when you worked at American Cyanamid?

         10      A.    No, ma'am, I sure can't.

         11      Q.    Can you give me an idea about the

         12  decade?

         13      A.    No, ma'am, I sure don't.

         14      Q.    Can you give me an idea whether

         15  it was -- Did you work as a direct employee

         16  of American Cyanamid?

         17      A.    No, ma'am.  If I did, it would

         18  have been a contract in insulating, and it

         19  would have been a short time.  Right now I

         20  just remember American Cyanamid.  I recall

         21  working there, but I don't know how long

         22  ago it was, how long I worked there.  It

         23  would have been insulating because that's

         24  all I did in my life in the forty years I

         25  worked.

          1      Q.    I appreciate that, Mr. Dempster.

          2  Would it be before the time you worked as

          3  an insulator at Avondale or after?

          4      A.    That was after.

          5      Q.    It would have been after?

          6      A.    Yes, ma'am.

          7      Q.    I apologize.  I don't have copies

          8  of your deposition.

         13  EXAMINATION BY MS. PARKINSON:

         14      Q.    All I want to ask is, can you

         15  tell me when it was you worked as an

         16  insulator at Avondale?  I admit that

         17  probably is going to be in your prior

         18  deposition, but I didn't have that

         19  information available to me.

         20      A.    What was the question again?

         21      Q.    Can you tell me when it was that

         22  you worked as an insulator at Avondale?

         23      A.    1965 to '74.

          3                  I have at least one other

          4            question.

          5  EXAMINATION BY MR. BALHOFF:

          6      Q.    In one of your previous

          7  depositions, you had stated that when

          8  insulators such as yourself took materials

          9  out of containers, just taking them out

         10  would create dust.  What materials are you

         11  talking about?

         12      A.    The pipe covering, mostly, and

         13  your blanket material.

         14      Q.    Any other materials?

         15      A.    I imagine -- I know the cloth, if

         16  you ripped it -- We used to cut it and rip

         17  it, and that would create dust.

         19                  He's talking about when you

         20            took it out of boxes.

         21            BY THE WITNESS:

         22                  Most of the boxes was like

         23            pipe covering, and, you know,

         24            like I said, asbestos.

          1      Q.    Did you ever take those materials

          2  out of their boxes while you were aboard

          3  the vessels?

          4      A.    Yeah.  We would take them out of

          5  the boxes before we get on the vessels.

          6  That's how we used to carry it on the ship.

          7      Q.    Just so I'm clear, did you ever

          8  take those materials out of the boxes while

          9  you were on the vessels?

         10      A.    Yes.

         11      Q.    Did you ever take those materials

         12  out of their boxes while other crafts, such

         13  as electricians, were around you?

         14      A.    Oh, yeah.

         15            BY MR. BALHOFF:

         16                  Those are all the questions

         17            I have for you, Mr. Dempster.

         18                  Anybody else?

         19                  (NO RESPONSE)

         22            your time today.
