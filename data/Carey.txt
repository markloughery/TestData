10:02:31   2   (10.30 am)

10:28:24   3                 Opening submissions by MR McCALL

10:32:12   4   MR McCALL:  May it please my Lord, I appear with Tom Smith

10:32:15   5       for GHU; my learned(edit) friends Lord Grabiner,

10:32:17   6       Mr McMullan QC, Andrew De Mestre and Douglas Paine

10:32:24   7       appear for Carey.

10:32:26   8           My Lord, I don't think either party has anything by

10:32:28   9       way of housekeeping or anything else that we need to

10:32:30  10       say, so subject to anything you would want to raise now,

10:32:33  11       I am going to crack straight on with my opening(edit)

10:32:33  12       submissions.

10:32:35  13   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  I have some housekeeping but let's deal(edit)

10:32:37  14       with it later.

10:32:39  15   MR McCALL:  Very good, my Lord.  There is a lot to get(edit)

10:32:42  16       through today(edit), so I will have to take it at a fair pace.

10:32:46  17           You know that(edit) the claim is for damages based on the

10:32:46  18       premise that but for Carey's breaches of the loan(edit)

10:32:49  19       agreement, the development would have proceeded to

10:32:50  20       completion, GHU would have run the hotel profitably, and

10:32:56  21       on that basis, it claims losses expressed in the

10:32:59  22       currencies in which they fell, in sterling of nearly

10:33:04  23       £292 million, less euros saved of nearly 220 million.

10:33:10  24           My Lord, if you were to do a conversion as at

10:33:12  25       yesterday's rates, that comes out at about £116 million.


                                             1
10:33:17   1           Carey counterclaims for(edit) repayment under the loan

10:33:21   2       agreement in the sum of €55.4 million, and that includes

10:33:26   3       interest up to 23 December 2009.

10:33:32   4           My Lord, I would like to start by looking at the two

10:33:35   5       key agreements, the loan agreement and the SPA.

10:33:37   6   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Certainly.

10:33:38   7   MR McCALL:  As I do that, I will pick up on some issues of

10:33:41   8       interpretation that run through many of the themes in

10:33:43   9       this case and some related topics.

10:33:46  10           Just by way of background to that, you will recall

10:33:48  11       that the acquisition of the property and the first

10:33:51  12       stages of the development were funded under a facility

10:33:53  13       with the Spanish bank BBVA, which was dated

10:34:01  14       22 December 2004.  It was amended and restated on

10:34:05  15       20 November 2007, and 31 December 2007 as well.  That's

10:34:09  16       the BBVA credit agreement, and it provided a euro term

10:34:15  17       loan facility for the euro equivalent of £87.67 million,

10:34:21  18       and as you know it was secured by first charge over the

10:34:25  19       property.  The reference to the BBVA agreement is F4,

10:34:29  20       tab 2, page 48.

10:34:36  21   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Yes, I see, thank you.

10:34:38  22   MR McCALL:  My Lord, although under its terms the BBVA loan

10:34:41  23       was repayable in instalments from December 2008 for the

10:34:45  24       next 12 years, the effect of the SPA was that, as

10:34:50  25       between GHU and Carey, the BBVA loan had to be repaid on


                                             2
10:34:55   1       completion of the development and the BBVA charge,

10:35:02   2       discharged at that point.  Obviously that was to enable

10:35:06   3       Carey or its nominee LVA to acquire the property

10:35:08   4       unencumbered under the SPA.

10:35:12   5           My Lord, again, just by way of background before we

10:35:15   6       get on to the main agreement, there was also as you know

10:35:18   7       an agreement for lease between Urvasco and LPS dated

10:35:22   8       June 2006.  The reference is F2/1, page 1. {F2/1/1}

10:35:27   9           There is no need to go to that, my Lord, but that

10:35:31  10       again was an agreement for Urvasco to grant LPS a long

10:35:35  11       lease, 999 year lease of the apartments at the date of

10:35:39  12       practical completion.  So that applied only to the

10:35:41  13       apartments, not to the hotel, and the consideration

10:35:45  14       payable for that was ultimately going to be £71 million.

10:35:50  15       Certain deposits were paid by LPS which meant that on

10:35:55  16       completion, GHU would receive £64 million from LPS.

10:36:00  17           During 2007, my Lord, it became apparent that

10:36:02  18       additional funds would be needed to complete the

10:36:05  19       development.  GHU therefore entered the arrangements

10:36:08  20       with Carey which amount to a sale and leaseback

10:36:12  21       arrangement, and that took place on 21 December 2007.

10:36:16  22           Apart from the loan agreement and the sale and

10:36:19  23       purchase agreement there was of course a call option

10:36:22  24       agreement of the same date.  That's F4, tab 1.  {F4/1}

10:36:26  25       There is no need to go there again, my Lord, but that


                                             3
10:36:29   1       was the third of the three agreements which were central

10:36:31   2       to the arrangements between the parties, the overall

10:36:33   3       effect of which was as follows: development of the hotel

10:36:36   4       and apartments would be by GHU through Urvasco, there

10:36:40   5       would be a sale of the property to Carey or its nominee,

10:36:44   6       LVA, on completion, there would be an immediate

10:36:49   7       leaseback of the property to GHU or its nominee for

10:36:52   8       ten years with an option to renew for ten, and there was

10:36:56   9       also the call option, as I mentioned, under which GHU

10:36:59  10       would have the right to acquire the property or the

10:37:01  11       shares in the owning entity at any time during the

10:37:04  12       seventh anniversary of the lease agreement.

10:37:07  13           GHU's case is, and always has been, that it would

10:37:10  14       have exercised the call option, it was in the money, it

10:37:12  15       would have reacquired the property, but that it lost the

10:37:16  16       opportunity to do that because of Carey's conduct in

10:37:18  17       failing to meet its obligations under the loan

10:37:21  18       agreement.

10:37:21  19           So with that background, could we please go to the

10:37:25  20       loan agreement in bundle F3.

10:37:27  21   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Yes, it's in the core bundle, but for the

10:37:31  22       moment you can give me the page references from the F

10:37:34  23       bundle.

10:37:41  24   MR McCALL:  My Lord, thank you.  F3, tab 4, page 169.

10:37:42  25       {F3/4/169}


                                             4
10:37:43   1   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Yes.

10:37:45   2   MR McCALL:  My Lord, I'll go quickly through the passages

10:37:48   3       that don't matter too much and dwell more on the others.

10:37:51   4   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Thank you.

10:37:52   5   MR McCALL:  The parties to the loan agreement are GHU and

10:37:54   6       Carey, that's the first defendant.  You will have noted

10:37:57   7       from clause 11(g) on page 182 that this is governed by

10:38:02   8       Spanish law.

10:38:03   9   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Yes.

10:38:04  10   MR McCALL:  Going to page 173, {F3/4/173} clause 2, you will

10:38:09  11       see there that the maximum amount of the loan was the

10:38:12  12       euro equivalent of £70 million.  Clause 3 deals with the

10:38:18  13       availability of the loan, and we are concerned

10:38:21  14       particularly with subparagraphs (b) and (c)(i), so:

10:38:26  15           "The loan will only be available if on the proposed

10:38:30  16       drawdown date:

10:38:33  17           " (b) in the case of subsequent tranches, a project

10:38:33  18       certificate duly certified by the monitoring surveyor",

10:38:35  19       that's G&T, Gardiner & Theobald, has been delivered,

10:38:41  20       and:

10:38:41  21           "(c) in the case of the first tranche, the second

10:38:46  22       tranche and any subsequent tranches:

10:38:46  23           "No default is continuing or would result from the

10:38:48  24       proposed drawdown."

10:38:51  25           My Lord, to put that into context and deal with


                                             5
10:38:54   1       defaults, we need to go to, jump ahead, please, to

10:38:58   2       clause 10, page 181.  {F3/4/181}

10:39:05   3           (a), dealing with the consequences of default:

10:39:14   4           "... the purchaser [that's Carey] shall be entitled

10:39:16   5       by notice to the seller to:

10:39:18   6           "(i) demand immediate repayment of all moneys ...

10:39:18   7       outstanding under the loan ... and/or

10:39:18   8           "(ii) to cancel the loan."

10:39:21   9           So very draconian consequences in the event of

10:39:25  10       default, and that's obviously the context in which GHU

10:39:28  11       will invite you to form a view about the extent to which

10:39:31  12       defaults have to be material, and that's a central theme

10:39:34  13       running through this case.

10:39:35  14           Then at 10(b) itself, this defines events of

10:39:40  15       default.  My Lord, you are concerned with all of those

10:39:44  16       subclauses (i) through to (iv) and I will address you

10:39:50  17       later about the question of whether those defaults had

10:39:52  18       to be material.  But for present purposes can I just

10:39:55  19       invite you to note that in subclause (iii) there is

10:39:59  20       an express requirement of materiality, in other words

10:40:03  21       the representation has to be untrue when made in any

10:40:07  22       material respect.

10:40:14  23           Now, on the question of default, we also need to go

10:40:17  24       back to the definitions section on page 170, {F3/4/170}

10:40:26  25       where "Default" with a capital D is defined.  It means:


                                             6
10:40:31   1           "... any event or circumstance specified or referred

10:40:34   2       to in clause 10(b) or event or circumstance which would

10:40:38   3       (with the expiry of a grace period, the giving of

10:40:39   4       notice, the making of any determination or any

10:40:43   5       combination of the foregoing) be an event or

10:40:44   6       circumstance specified or referred to in clause 10(b)."

10:40:51   7           My Lord, with that in mind, going back to clause 3

10:40:53   8       on page 173, {F3/4/173} Carey's position, based on the

10:41:00   9       definition we just looked at, is that for the purpose of

10:41:03  10       clause 3(c)(i), if a capital D Default existed on

10:41:09  11       a proposed drawdown date then Carey was not obliged to

10:41:14  12       make the tranche available, even if it gave no notice of

10:41:17  13       that default or presumably even if it did not then know

10:41:20  14       of the existence of that default.

10:41:22  15           My Lord, I accept that if you were to ignore the

10:41:26  16       gloss of Spanish law or implied terms, that is what the

10:41:30  17       words say on their face, so I do accept that.

10:41:36  18           However, GHU's case is that the loan agreement must

10:41:38  19       be interpreted subject to the Spanish Civil Code, one of

10:41:43  20       the effects of which is that breaches or defaults may

10:41:46  21       only be relied on if clear and specific notice of them

10:41:49  22       is given.

10:41:50  23           Now, I am going to return to that later, because

10:41:53  24       it's more complicated than I've just explained, but that

10:41:56  25       in a nutshell is what we will say.


                                             7
10:41:58   1           My Lord, going on in the agreement at page 174,

10:42:02   2       {F3/4/174} we have clause 4, which deals with the

10:42:05   3       mechanism for drawdown.  We are concerned with

10:42:09   4       4(a)(iii), which is dealing with subsequent tranches.

10:42:15   5       So 4(a)(iii) in relation to subsequent tranches the

10:42:19   6       drawdown is on subsequent advance dates.  That's defined

10:42:22   7       on page 173, the previous page.  {F3/4/173}  It's the

10:42:25   8       date which falls no earlier than three business days

10:42:29   9       after the delivery each month of the relevant project

10:42:32  10       certificate.

10:42:33  11           "Project Certificates" are defined on page 172,

10:42:36  12       {F3/4/172} they are the certificates to be issued by

10:42:38  13       Gardiner & Theobald in accordance with schedule 3 of the

10:42:42  14       SPA.

10:42:42  15           So in other words, my Lord, each subsequent tranche

10:42:45  16       could be drawn down three business days after the

10:42:49  17       delivery of the relevant project certificate by G&T.

10:42:55  18           Now, actually, my Lord, might be a good point to

10:42:57  19       draw attention to I think two technical points taken by

10:43:01  20       Carey about the drawdown process.  My Lord, for your

10:43:04  21       note, this is a point taken in paragraph 46 of the

10:43:08  22       defence at bundle A1, pages 49 to 50, although it's not

10:43:15  23       necessary to go there. {A1/49}

10:43:17  24           The points are this: first, that GHU did not specify

10:43:21  25       a subsequent advance date.


                                             8
10:43:23   1   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  This is in one of the appendices, is it?

10:43:26   2   MR McCALL:  It is, my Lord, yes.

10:43:27   3   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Just tell me which appendix.

10:43:30   4   MR McCALL:  We address it in appendix 1; Carey I think in

10:43:34   5       appendix ... (Pause).  My Lord, I'll tell you in one

10:44:02   6       moment where Carey address it.  We address it in 1.

10:44:04   7       My Lord, there are two points, and I'll give you the

10:44:07   8       reference in a moment, if I may.

10:44:09   9           The first point they make is that GHU did not

10:44:11  10       specify a subsequent advance date for the April tranche.

10:44:14  11       That's the one that became due on 6 June, so it's

10:44:17  12       probably the most important tranche, as they say was

10:44:22  13       required by clause 4(a)(iii).

10:44:27  14           The second point they make is that GHU did not serve

10:44:29  15       a written drawdown notice for the purpose of

10:44:33  16       clause 4(b).  My Lord, as I said, GHU addresses those

10:44:38  17       points in appendix 1.

10:44:41  18           Just to deal quickly with the point, in essence,

10:44:45  19       GHU's case is that no particular form of notification

10:44:47  20       was required or stipulated, but if it was, then the

10:44:52  21       subsequent advance date was sufficiently specified in

10:44:55  22       the communications which are set out in appendix 1.

10:45:08  23       My Lord, if I could, however, draw attention to one

10:45:11  24       point that is raised in Carey's opening, written

10:45:16  25       opening, in bundle A4.  I don't know whether you have


                                             9
10:45:20   1       those in a separate bundle, my Lord, this is at page 144

10:45:26   2       of the bundle.  {A4/8/144}

10:45:28   3   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  This is Carey's opening?

10:45:29   4   MR McCALL:  This is Carey's opening, appendix 8,

10:45:33   5       paragraph 7.1, page 144.

10:45:52   6   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Right.

10:45:52   7   MR McCALL:  My Lord, I don't know whether you have read

10:45:54   8       paragraph 7.1, where --

10:45:56   9   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  I am sorry, page 144?

10:45:58  10   MR McCALL:  Yes.

10:45:59  11   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Of appendix 8?

10:46:00  12   MR McCALL:  Yes.

10:46:03  13   MR McMULLAN:  It's internal page 138.

10:46:06  14   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Thank you.  Yes, I have it.

10:46:08  15   MR McCALL:  Thank you.  Well, my Lord, this you may think is

10:46:11  16       an example, what they are saying here, namely that

10:46:15  17       notices had to be given by fax or post to a specified

10:46:19  18       address, and that in the last three lines of

10:46:22  19       paragraph 7.1 they say that the point applies in

10:46:25  20       relation to the April tranche where GHU relies only on

10:46:27  21       email communications until a letter of 12 June.

10:46:30  22           So they are taking what is on any basis a technical

10:46:33  23       point.  You may, my Lord, think that is an example, and

10:46:36  24       there are several others in this case, of Carey taking

10:46:40  25       a point that's completely uncommercial which ignores the


                                            10
10:46:44   1       way the parties actually operated without demur on

10:46:48   2       either side throughout the operation of the arrangements

10:46:52   3       between them.  Email was the normal mode of

10:46:55   4       communication on both sides, as you will see throughout

10:47:00   5       the trial.

10:47:01   6           I will refer to that sort of point later in the

10:47:04   7       context of development information, where you may think

10:47:08   8       that some of the points taken by Carey are not

10:47:11   9       commercially realistic.

10:47:14  10           So, my Lord, if you can go back to the loan

10:47:17  11       agreement in bundle F3, tab 4, at page 174, {F3/4/174}

10:47:22  12       we have come on to clause 6, which deals with repayment.

10:47:33  13       My Lord, under clause 6(b) GHU, who is the seller, is

10:47:40  14       entitled to set off against its obligation to repay the

10:47:42  15       loan on completion any of the purchase price then due

10:47:46  16       under the SPA.  Then clause 8 on the next page,

10:47:51  17       {F3/4/175} that sets out various representations made by

10:47:55  18       GHU on its own behalf and on behalf of Urvasco, and you

10:48:01  19       will recall that we looked at clause 10(b)(iii) earlier,

10:48:07  20       there is one of these representations that is not true,

10:48:09  21       only gives rise to an event of default if it is

10:48:12  22       material.

10:48:14  23           I will return to these individual provisions under

10:48:17  24       clause 8 in more detail as necessary later, but just for

10:48:22  25       present purposes, the ones that you will probably be


                                            11
10:48:24   1       invited to look at are (e) on page 176, {F3/4/176}

10:48:29   2       particularly (e)(ii), that there is no outstanding

10:48:34   3       breach of any term of the development document.  The

10:48:38   4       development document you should know includes the

10:48:40   5       building contracts and the appointment of professionals

10:48:43   6       such as Foster & Partners and the engineers

10:48:47   7       Buro Happold.

10:48:49   8           Clause 10(h) is the MAC clause, "no material adverse

10:48:50   9       change", I'll return to that later.

10:48:54  10           (j) on the top of 177 {F3/4/177}is concerned with

10:48:58  11       the accuracy of information provided in connection with

10:49:01  12       development.  It doesn't create an obligation to provide

10:49:05  13       particular information, rather it says that what is

10:49:08  14       provided must be accurate, and note the reference to

10:49:12  15       materiality in subclause (ii), in other words GHU is

10:49:19  16       also representing that:

10:49:20  17           "It has not omitted to supply any information which

10:49:24  18       would make other information in (i) above untrue or

10:49:28  19       misleading in any material respect ..."

10:49:31  20           The reference to "materiality" in (j)(ii) clearly,

10:49:36  21       on GHU's case, also informs (j)(i) and supports GHU's

10:49:45  22       argument of construction that the whole of this clause

10:49:49  23       is concerned only with material default.

10:49:53  24           Then 8(k), just below that, a similar representation

10:49:58  25       but this is concerned with development information


                                            12
10:50:00   1       provided under the SPA.  Note that both in subclauses

10:50:07   2       (i) and (ii) of that there are materiality thresholds,

10:50:10   3       if I can put it that way.

10:50:11   4           I think finally (w), on page 180, {F3/4/180} is

10:50:26   5       concerned with insolvency, where there is

10:50:35   6       a representation that GHU hasn't taken corporate action,

10:50:36   7       no other steps have been taken or legal proceedings

10:50:37   8       started, et cetera, for its winding-up, dissolution,

10:50:40   9       et cetera.

10:50:41  10           My Lord, you also need to see the last three lines

10:50:45  11       of clause 8 which are just above clause 9 on page 181.

10:50:51  12       {F3/4/181} In effect, GHU is deemed to repeat those

10:50:54  13       representations each time a subsequent advance date

10:51:00  14       arrives.

10:51:06  15           Below that we have clause 9.  9(a) is an undertaking

10:51:11  16       to comply with schedule 3 to the SPA throughout the

10:51:13  17       terms of the loan.  I'll go to that in a minute,

10:51:15  18       my Lord, but in brief schedule 3 concerns the control

10:51:21  19       and conduct of the development prior to completion.

10:51:25  20       9(b), that this is GHU's agreement to grant to Carey on

10:51:30  21       request a second charge over the property.  As you have

10:51:34  22       probably seen, GHU did indeed on request execute

10:51:38  23       a second charge which came into effect on

10:51:42  24       11 August 2008.  That is at F5, tabs 1 to 4, no need to

10:51:49  25       go there at the moment.


                                            13
10:51:51   1           Now, my Lord, my final words about the

10:51:55   2       interpretation of the loan agreement relate to Spanish

10:51:57   3       law, and I said I would come back to this.  This is

10:52:02   4       addressed in appendix 9 to GHU's submissions.  I want to

10:52:08   5       address you on two fronts, both with regard to the

10:52:11   6       requirement of notice and then materiality under the

10:52:14   7       loan agreement.  In relation to notice, Carey's case, as

10:52:21   8       you have seen, is that under clause 3(c)(i), which is

10:52:25   9       the drawdown provision, if a default is continuing on

10:52:30  10       a proposed drawdown date, then no subsequent tranche

10:52:34  11       will be available, irrespective of whether or not notice

10:52:37  12       was given.  That's Carey's position.

10:52:39  13           GHU's case on the requirements for notice has two

10:52:43  14       limbs, as explained in appendix 9.  The first limb is

10:52:47  15       that the loan agreement must be interpreted in

10:52:50  16       accordance with the Spanish Civil Code.  Articles 7.1

10:52:54  17       and 12.58 imported an obligation of good faith on the

10:53:00  18       parties which meant that the contractual regime was

10:53:03  19       subject to an obligation owed by Carey to communicate

10:53:06  20       clearly and specifically to GHU the breaches of contract

10:53:10  21       on which it seeks to rely.  That's paragraph 19 of

10:53:14  22       appendix 9.  The consequences of that, my Lord, are

10:53:18  23       that, first, clear notice of the alleged breach which is

10:53:22  24       said to excuse performance had to be given

10:53:25  25       contemporaneously and, second, the breaches had to be


                                            14
10:53:28   1       identified with proper specificity.

10:53:33   2           However, GHU accepts that if clear and specific

10:53:38   3       notice is --

10:53:41   4   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  What paragraph are you on now?

10:53:44   5   MR McCALL:  My Lord, I've just dealt with paragraph 19 of

10:53:54   6       appendix 9.

10:54:00   7   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Thank you.

10:54:00   8   MR McCALL:  My Lord, I accept that if clear and specific

10:54:03   9       notice is given of a default, then Carey is entitled to

10:54:08  10       rely on that default, even if it's not material, as long

10:54:15  11       as it's a default that is specified in the contract.

10:54:19  12       That's the sort of notice threshold: if clear, specific

10:54:22  13       notice is given, then Carey is entitled to rely on that

10:54:26  14       provision even if it is not material.

10:54:29  15           My Lord, however --

10:54:30  16   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  What paragraph is that?  Just so I can

10:54:33  17       note it.

10:54:44  18   MR McCALL:  My Lord, this is picked up from the first report

10:54:46  19       of Professor Yzquierdo.  Whether that is specifically

10:54:50  20       stated in the appendix I doubt.

10:54:54  21   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  No.

10:54:55  22   MR McCALL:  I wanted to make that clear, partly for that

10:54:57  23       reason, my Lord.

10:54:59  24   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Thank you very much.

10:55:01  25   MR McCALL:  The second limb of our position on notice is


                                            15
10:55:04   1       that, under general Spanish law, if Carey does not give

10:55:09   2       proper and specific notice, it may nevertheless be

10:55:13   3       entitled to rely on a default, but only to the extent

10:55:16   4       that the default is material, and we deal with that in

10:55:21   5       paragraph 24 of the submissions.  That's the second part

10:55:30   6       of paragraph 24.

10:55:32   7           So, my Lord, moving on to materiality under Spanish

10:55:35   8       law, I have already mentioned the various express

10:55:39   9       references to materiality thresholds in the loan

10:55:44  10       agreement including clauses 8(h), (j), (k) and

10:55:49  11       10(b)(iii).

10:55:52  12           Over and above that, it's GHU's case that under the

10:55:55  13       Spanish law there is an implied requirement that

10:55:57  14       a breach must be material in order to give rise to

10:56:01  15       a default.  That's a consequence of the doctrine of good

10:56:05  16       faith that I mentioned earlier, to which the loan

10:56:08  17       agreement is subject, and it's a result of Article 11.24

10:56:12  18       of the Civil Code which applies to the termination of

10:56:15  19       contracts and the right to refuse to perform obligations

10:56:18  20       under the general law.

10:56:20  21           So in other words, the only exception to the

10:56:22  22       requirement of materiality would be if a contract

10:56:26  23       specifies a type of default which is non-material and

10:56:31  24       specific proper notice is given of that.  In that case

10:56:35  25       the parties giving notice could rely on that default,


                                            16
10:56:38   1       even if it were not material.

10:56:41   2           My Lord, turning then to the sale and purchase

10:56:42   3       agreement, this is F3, tab 3, page 90.  {F3/3/90} As you

10:56:55   4       know, the parties to the sale and purchase agreement are

10:56:58   5       GHU as the seller and Carey, that's the first defendant,

10:57:02   6       as the purchaser.  Also Carey's nominee, which is LVA,

10:57:15   7       the second defendant --

10:57:16   8   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Did that ever change name or not?

10:57:17   9   MR McCALL:  I don't think so, no.  My Lord, unlike the loan

10:57:18  10       agreement, this is subject to English law, that's

10:57:19  11       clause 21.1.  The first few clauses set out the basis on

10:57:23  12       which the nominee, LVA, would purchase shares in Urvasco

10:57:26  13       on completion.  So we could begin on page 102, please,

10:57:32  14       clause 2.1.  {F3/3/102} That deals with the sale by GHU,

10:57:38  15       the seller, to LVA of the shares in Urvasco on

10:57:49  16       completion.

10:57:49  17           We can then go on to 2.6 on page 103, {F3/3/103}

10:57:54  18       this sets out various deliverables as at the date of the

10:57:58  19       SPA, particularly there is a requirement under (a)(i)

10:58:04  20       for GHU to deliver a parent guarantee, which it did, and

10:58:08  21       then (v) that the loan agreement duly executed, and

10:58:11  22       below that (vi), the BBVA intercreditor agreement.  They

10:58:15  23       were all delivered and similarly Carey had corresponding

10:58:20  24       obligations just below that.

10:58:24  25           If we can go on to page 104, {F3/3/104} clause 3.1,


                                            17
10:58:28   1       which deals with purchase price, so the total price for

10:58:32   2       the shares, which is defined as "the purchase price",

10:58:36   3       shall be, and then we have (a), which is the property

10:58:41   4       value.  I think, my Lord, Carey does not dispute that in

10:58:44   5       this case the property value would have been

10:58:46   6       £105 million, although there is a range specified there,

10:58:49   7       but 105 million is the figure that would have been

10:58:53   8       specified, that seems to be accepted in the defence at

10:58:56   9       paragraph 86(d)(i).

10:59:00  10           The consequence of choosing a higher property value

10:59:03  11       is that the higher the value, the higher the rent would

10:59:06  12       have been that GHU would have to pay on renting back the

10:59:11  13       hotel, there is a mechanism for that.

10:59:17  14           The property vale which is (a), plus or minus (b)

10:59:17  15       which is the deficit or surplus in the net value of

10:59:21  16       Urvasco as at completion.  So that's the purchase price.

10:59:27  17           Clause 3.2 says that the purchase price is to be

10:59:31  18       paid on completion, but that's qualified by 3.6.  Not

10:59:37  19       qualified, but there is a gloss on it, 3.6, which says

10:59:41  20       that Carey or LVA could set off against the purchase

10:59:46  21       price the sums due by way of repayment of the loan from

10:59:51  22       GHU.

10:59:55  23           Moving on to clause 4.1, completion was conditional

10:59:57  24       on the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set

11:00:02  25       out in schedule 2, and we can quickly go to that at


                                            18
11:00:06   1       page 121.  {F3/3/121} The key ones at page 121 in

11:00:16   2       schedule 2 were, number 1, the issue of the certificate

11:00:19   3       of practical completion.  That means the building is

11:00:22   4       effectively finished, bar snagging items.  6, the

11:00:25   5       discharge of BBVA security and repayment of the BBVA

11:00:28   6       loan, and 8, evidence that the company, that's Urvasco,

11:00:34   7       has net assets at completion.

11:00:43   8           So we can go back now to page 106, please,

11:00:47   9       {F3/3/106} and clause 4.4 on page 106.  These are

11:00:56  10       obligations of notification.  (b) and (c) we are

11:01:03  11       concerned with, which create an obligation on both

11:01:06  12       parties to notify the other on becoming aware that any

11:01:09  13       of the conditions in schedule 2:

11:01:13  14           "(b) will or is likely to be delayed", in other

11:01:18  15       words that's the long stop date, or (c) the long stop

11:01:22  16       date has become incapable of satisfaction.

11:01:29  17           Below that, clause 4.5, this is concerned with

11:01:32  18       Carey's entitlement to rescind or terminate the SPA if

11:01:36  19       the schedule 2 conditions are not satisfied by the long

11:01:39  20       stop date.

11:01:43  21           On the next page, {F3/3/107} clause 4.6, this is

11:01:51  22       an undertaking by GHU to procure that Urvasco will

11:01:56  23       comply with schedule 3.  I'll go to that later, because

11:01:59  24       that's quite important.

11:02:05  25           I think we can go to 6.4 at the bottom of page 108.


                                            19
11:02:10   1       {F3/3/108} This gives Carey the right to rescind the SPA

11:02:14   2       in the event of any material breach of warranties.

11:02:20   3       That's clause 4.6 and schedule 3, so rescission is

11:02:25   4       subject to a materiality threshold.

11:02:33   5           Then on the next page, {F3/3/109} this deals with

11:02:36   6       the consequences of rescission, clause 6.5, which says

11:02:41   7       that on Carey rescinding the agreement, GHU would be

11:02:46   8       immediately obliged to repay the loan plus interest.

11:02:52   9           I think finally in the body of the agreement we can

11:02:54  10       go to 6.17, which is on page 111 {F3/3/111} of the

11:03:01  11       bundle.  My Lord, 6.17 falls into two parts.  The first

11:03:07  12       five lines or so are dealing with the situation where

11:03:13  13       Carey fails to advance a tranche which is due to be

11:03:17  14       advanced, and fails to remedy that within 30 days of

11:03:20  15       being required to do so.  Well, in that situation the

11:03:23  16       clause says that GHU would be entitled to rescind the

11:03:25  17       SPA, in which event the loan would not be repayable.

11:03:32  18           My Lord, just by way of putting that in context, on

11:03:36  19       GHU's case, as you know, that's exactly what happened

11:03:39  20       and the loan is not therefore repayable.  If I can deal

11:03:48  21       with the issue that arises on that quite quickly: Carey

11:03:50  22       says that clause 6.17, at least that part of it, is

11:03:51  23       a penalty and unenforceable or that its effect is to

11:03:54  24       allow GHU to forfeit the loan agreement, in which case

11:03:57  25       Carey would be entitled to relief from forfeiture.  It's


                                            20
11:04:01   1       also said by Carey that GHU affirmed the loan agreement

11:04:04   2       and the SPA in various ways but in particular by

11:04:08   3       entering what you have probably seen, the

11:04:10   4       21 October 2008 agreement.  So that's Carey's position.

11:04:15   5           GHU's position on those issues is addressed in

11:04:18   6       appendix 10, my Lord, to its written opening

11:04:22   7       submissions.

11:04:25   8   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Yes.

11:04:26   9   MR McCALL:  Also in appendix 13 in relation to the

11:04:28  10       21 October agreement.

11:04:33  11           My Lord, if I could deal briefly with the 21 October

11:04:36  12       agreement, because then it's out of the way and I don't

11:04:37  13       need to come back to it.

11:04:39  14   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Which appendix is that again?

11:04:42  15   MR McCALL:  The agreement is F5.

11:04:43  16   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  No, no, where you deal with it.

11:04:48  17   MR McCALL:  We deal with it in appendix 10 and 13,

11:04:50  18       principally in 13.  In essence, the position -- although

11:05:04  19       Spanish law comes into it, on analysis the position is

11:05:06  20       quite simple: it's a question of construction, and GHU

11:05:12  21       submits that the 21 October agreement was simply

11:05:14  22       a moratorium agreement, a standstill agreement, to allow

11:05:18  23       the parties a period of time to facilitate the

11:05:21  24       substitution of Carey by a replacement funder.  So you

11:05:25  25       will remember this is well after Carey has said it won't


                                            21
11:05:28   1       pay the loan any more, there has been a period when the

11:05:31   2       parties have tried to accelerate the sale of Urvasco,

11:05:35   3       but that has not happened, and Carey has sought to

11:05:39   4       terminate or has terminated the loan agreement.

11:05:42   5           So the parties want a period of time to facilitate

11:05:46   6       the substitution of Carey as a funder and to find

11:05:50   7       a replacement funder, and to that end, made provision

11:05:55   8       for the amounts that would be payable to Carey in the

11:05:58   9       event that it was substituted as funder under the loan

11:06:02  10       agreement and the SPA.  That's all it did.  In fact,

11:06:07  11       that agreement lapsed without such a substitution taking

11:06:11  12       place and the parties' legal rights were unaffected.

11:06:19  13           As for the argument that clause 6.17 is a penalty,

11:06:23  14       well, we advance several arguments on that which are

11:06:29  15       dealt with in appendix 10.  My Lord, first, clause 6.17

11:06:35  16       is not a penalty because it doesn't require the payment

11:06:38  17       of any sum of money by Carey; rather, it precludes Carey

11:06:44  18       from being able to recover any money which has already

11:06:47  19       been advanced, and thus it works as a forfeiture

11:06:51  20       provision, not as a penalty, and Carey would not be

11:06:54  21       entitled to relief from forfeiture.  The reasons for

11:06:58  22       that are set out in appendix 10, paragraphs 61 to 64,

11:07:02  23       which I don't propose to elaborate on now.

11:07:15  24           The second argument is that clause 6.17 is not

11:07:18  25       a penalty clause because the triggering event is not


                                            22
11:07:21   1       a breach of contract which you would expect to find in

11:07:24   2       a penalty clause, but rather it's the exercise by GHU of

11:07:29   3       the right to rescind the SPA under clause 6.17.

11:07:37   4           The third point we make in relation to penalties is

11:07:40   5       that the law on penalties is not engaged because the

11:07:44   6       effect of 6.17 is to make a liability to repay the loan

11:07:48   7       conditional on the provision of tranches when they

11:07:53   8       become due.  So therefore the question is whether those

11:07:57   9       conditions required for repayment of the loan have been

11:08:01  10       satisfied, rather than whether the so-called innocent

11:08:05  11       party requires the other party to pay a penalty as

11:08:12  12       a result of breach of contract.

11:08:13  13           So those are our arguments about penalty.

11:08:15  14           Going back, if we may, to the clause itself, 6.17,

11:08:19  15       {F3/3/111}  there is a second limb to clause 6.17, as

11:08:36  16       you know, which begins:

11:08:38  17           "In the event of delay on the part of the purchaser

11:08:42  18       in advancing any tranche, the long stop date shall be

11:08:46  19       extended by a equivalent period."

11:08:51  20           The significance of that --

11:08:54  21   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Those are the extra couple of weeks that

11:08:57  22       you said were added on.

11:08:58  23   MR McCALL:  It's an extra couple of weeks up to June and

11:09:01  24       then indefinitely after 6 June.

11:09:03  25           My Lord, can I ask you just to look at appendix 4


                                            23
11:09:05   1       where we deal with that, that's page 101 of bundle A3.

11:09:10   2       {A3/4/101}

11:09:17   3   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Sorry?

11:09:18   4   MR McCALL:  Bundle A3, these are GHU's submissions,

11:09:21   5       appendix 4, page 101.

11:09:24   6   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Yes.

11:09:39   7   MR McCALL:  My Lord, there is paragraph 12 --

11:09:42   8   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  What's the internal page reference?

11:09:44   9   MR McCALL:  The internal is 56.

11:09:53  10   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Thank you.

11:09:54  11   MR McCALL:  As you quite rightly said, 12.3, the effect of

11:09:58  12       various delays in payment was to extend the long stop

11:10:01  13       date to 14 May, and then in paragraph 12.4 our case is

11:10:07  14       that the long stop date was then extended indefinitely

11:10:11  15       because of the failure to pay any tranches after and

11:10:18  16       including the April tranche which was due on 6 June.

11:10:22  17           My Lord, going now to schedule 3, please, to the

11:10:26  18       SPA, that's at bundle F3, page 122.  {F3/4/122}

11:10:41  19       My Lord, we are concerned with the section beginning on

11:10:54  20       page 125, {F3/4/125} part 2, paragraph 1.1 and onwards.

11:11:02  21           My Lord, in relation to paragraph 1.1, which is

11:11:05  22       concerned with the meeting of the long stop date, GHU's

11:11:07  23       case on interpretation is set out in its written

11:11:11  24       submissions in appendix 4, paragraphs 8 to 24, that's

11:11:19  25       bundle A3, page 100 onwards. {magnum ref}


                                            24
11:11:22   1   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  There is no point giving me the A3

11:11:26   2       references because I don't have them.

11:11:28   3   MR McCALL:  I see, the internal page is 55 onwards.

11:11:30   4   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Thank you very much.

11:11:31   5   MR McCALL:  My Lord, the position, if I can put it shortly,

11:11:34   6       is this: we say that under paragraph 1.1 of part 2 of

11:11:39   7       schedule 3, GHU agreed to procure that Urvasco would use

11:11:45   8       its reasonable endeavours to procure the practical

11:11:47   9       completion shall have occurred by the long stop date by

11:11:53  10       doing the things specified in (a) and (b), so exercising

11:11:57  11       its rights and complying with its obligations the

11:11:59  12       contracts and (b) ensuring that as far as within

11:12:01  13       Urvasco's control that the counterparties, in other

11:12:04  14       words the builders and the professionals, would comply

11:12:06  15       with their relevant obligations.

11:12:08  16   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Yes.

11:12:08  17   MR McCALL:  The point of interpretation we make here is that

11:12:12  18       although Carey alleges breach of this provision, in fact

11:12:15  19       it's a clause which is only intended to be capable of

11:12:19  20       being invoked after the long stop date has passed.

11:12:24  21       My Lord, I accept that at first blush that is not

11:12:27  22       an obvious point.

11:12:29  23   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  It's the "shall have occurred" point.

11:12:32  24   MR McCALL:  Yes, it's the language "shall have occurred" but

11:12:35  25       also the fact that there are different provisions in the


                                            25
11:12:37   1       SPA that we looked at earlier dealing with the

11:12:39   2       prospective right to terminate, in particular

11:12:42   3       clause 4.4(b) and (c) on page 106.

11:12:49   4           Moving on, paragraph 1.3 on page 126, (a),

11:12:58   5       {F3/4/126} this is concerned with the monthly reports

11:13:00   6       that IDOM was required to produce, and supply to

11:13:05   7       Gardiner & Theobald on a monthly basis.  Those reports

11:13:09   8       were known as the Employer's Agent Reports and they were

11:13:15   9       produced monthly and reported on the status of the

11:13:15  10       development.  The EARs had to include at least the

11:13:19  11       information set out in paragraphs (i) through to (vi).

11:13:24  12           Then (c) just below that, GHU was obliged to procure

11:13:29  13       that Urvasco promptly inform G&T on becoming aware of,

11:13:35  14       and it lists the two matters.  (i) is any breach under

11:13:39  15       the development documents, that includes the building

11:13:44  16       contracts, and (ii) any claim or demand made against

11:13:48  17       Urvasco in connection with the development including any

11:13:52  18       claim likely to impact the budgeted costs, the long stop

11:13:55  19       date or the development timetable.

11:13:59  20           My Lord, GHU's case, both as a matter of the true

11:14:03  21       construction of the SPA or in accordance with implied

11:14:06  22       terms, is that GHU's obligations in 1.3(a) and (c) were

11:14:13  23       subject to materiality thresholds, and in particular if

11:14:19  24       we look at paragraph 1.3(a)(ii), it's our case that the

11:14:26  25       only reports on extensions of time that had to be


                                            26
11:14:31   1       notified were those which were likelihood to impact on

11:14:33   2       the ability of the development to be completed by the

11:14:35   3       long stop date, or rather the ability to complete the

11:14:40   4       development by the long stop date; and also particularly

11:14:44   5       under 1.3(c) it is our case that the requirements to

11:14:49   6       notify breaches and claims or demands only arose in

11:14:53   7       relation to breaches, claims or demands which were

11:14:54   8       material in the sense they were likely to impact on the

11:14:59   9       ability to complete the development by the long stop

11:15:00  10       date or on GHU's ability to repay the loan.

11:15:06  11           My Lord, this is obviously an important issue.

11:15:08  12   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Which one is that?

11:15:10  13   MR McCALL:  That's 1.3(c).

11:15:25  14   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Right, thank you.

11:15:26  15   MR McCALL:  My Lord, it's an important issue which will run

11:15:28  16       through this case.  I am not trying to open my case too

11:15:33  17       high on this, I accept it's a difficult question and

11:15:36  18       that the answer is probably not immediately obvious one

11:15:40  19       way or the other, but it's certainly our submission that

11:15:44  20       on a careful analysis -- and also once the

11:15:48  21       practicalities of planning and administering a major

11:15:53  22       building development of this sort are understood -- once

11:15:57  23       those things are considered then GHU's position does

11:16:00  24       become compelling.

11:16:04  25           My Lord, if I could just take you briefly through


                                            27
11:16:06   1       the principal reasons for that: first of all, if one

11:16:10   2       looks at the wording of paragraph 1.3(a)(ii), and

11:16:17   3       similarly 1.3(c)(ii), they both refer to impact on the

11:16:25   4       long stop date.

11:16:36   5           The second point, my Lord, is that both the SPA and

11:16:40   6       the loan agreement, and indeed some of the other

11:16:43   7       agreements we have mentioned, they were part of one

11:16:45   8       overall transaction, and should be construed with each

11:16:49   9       other in mind, particularly bearing in mind of course

11:16:53  10       that a breach under the SPA can in time give rise to

11:16:58  11       a default under the loan agreement.

11:17:01  12           So with that in mind, if you go back, please, to the

11:17:11  13       loan agreement, several of the clauses that Carey relies

11:17:12  14       on have materiality thresholds, as I mentioned, so

11:17:15  15       please could you go to page 177, so 8(k), {F3/4/177}

11:17:27  16       this is one of the representation clauses, and it

11:17:32  17       concerns the provision of information under the SPA:

11:17:34  18       that as.I.mentioned.earlier. has express materiality

11:17:37  19       thresholds in both of its subclauses.  Similarly (j) on

11:17:42  20       page 177 also, that's also concerned with the provision

11:17:47  21       of information, so it's a similar clause, it just

11:17:50  22       doesn't refer to the SPA.  And in (ii) as I mentioned

11:17:53  23       earlier, that has an express materiality threshold in

11:17:57  24       relation to the supply of information which would make

11:17:59  25       information referred to in (i) untrue or misleading in


                                            28
11:18:03   1       any material respect.  That reference to "materiality"

11:18:07   2       in (ii) on my submission plainly qualifies the

11:18:12   3       information that has to be provided under (i).

11:18:14   4           Then going on to page 181, {F3/4/181} as you have

11:18:17   5       already seen, clause 10, which deals with defaults,

11:18:23   6       10(b)(iii), as you have seen, has an express materiality

11:18:28   7       threshold, and that is the default clause relating to

11:18:31   8       untrue representations.

11:18:35   9           On my submission, it would be commercially

11:18:39  10       surprising, to say the least, if these various

11:18:43  11       provisions of the SPA and the loan agreement, all of

11:18:47  12       which concern the provision of information about the

11:18:49  13       development in one way or another, it would be

11:18:52  14       surprising if they were intended to have different

11:18:55  15       standards, if I could put it that way, with regard to

11:18:58  16       materiality.

11:19:02  17           My Lord, I also rely on the point I touched on a few

11:19:06  18       moments ago, which is that on a practical and hands-on

11:19:12  19       level, in a development of this sort we have numerous

11:19:16  20       different contractors practising different trades,

11:19:19  21       numerous suppliers, different types of professionals,

11:19:23  22       architects, engineers and so on, all these people being

11:19:27  23       administered and the programming being run in a dynamic

11:19:31  24       way, switching activities and that sort, the project had

11:19:34  25       to be constantly managed, revised, resequenced, as with


                                            29
11:19:39   1       all projects of this sort.  In that sort of scenario it

11:19:45   2       would have been impossible, in my submission, for IDOM

11:19:47   3       to report literally every matter which might be said to

11:19:52   4       constitute a breach.  So, for example, a late payment of

11:19:55   5       a small amount of money, late by a few days, it would

11:19:59   6       have been impossible, and nobody would have expected

11:20:03   7       IDOM to report something like that.  Or every tiny or

11:20:08   8       insignificant breach of a building contract.

11:20:10   9           There were working hours, for example: what if

11:20:13  10       a builder starts too early or goes on half an hour too

11:20:16  11       late?  I suppose that would be a breach.  Once you

11:20:19  12       accept, my Lord, that these small trivial matters

11:20:22  13       plainly don't have to be reported, then it begs the

11:20:24  14       question: well, what sort of thing does have to be

11:20:27  15       reported?  The answer to that is: matters the breach of

11:20:30  16       which would impact the development in the sense of

11:20:33  17       delaying the completion beyond the long stop date or

11:20:37  18       affecting the ability of GHU to repay what was due.

11:20:42  19           My Lord, not only would it have been an impossible

11:20:45  20       task to do what Carey now demands, but in my

11:20:47  21       submission -- and this will become clear through the

11:20:51  22       evidence -- nobody would have been interested.  The only

11:20:55  23       thing of significance was what I've said, which is

11:20:58  24       whether the long stop date would be impacted or whether

11:21:01  25       GHU, its ability to repay the loan, would be affected.


                                            30
11:21:16   1           My Lord, going on with the SPA, please can we go

11:21:19   2       back in bundle F3 to page 127. {F3/3/127}

11:21:22   3   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Are you coming back to this issue or not?

11:21:26   4   MR McCALL:  My Lord, I was not going to come back to that,

11:21:28   5       no, not in opening.

11:21:30   6   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Well, to what extent is there an issue

11:21:35   7       between the parties as to how this is to be proved?

11:21:39   8       Leave aside for a moment the interpretation of the

11:21:42   9       agreement.

11:21:45  10   MR McCALL:  Well, my Lord, I assume it's accepted that the

11:21:48  11       burden of proof in relation to all of the defaults

11:21:51  12       alleged lies with Carey.  My Lord, as to how it's going

11:21:55  13       to be proved, as far as possible, every allegation of

11:22:01  14       default that is alleged has been addressed by the

11:22:04  15       witnesses, principally by the IDOM witnesses, and with

11:22:08  16       almost no exception their case is that there was not

11:22:11  17       a breach, or if there was one it was one that was not in

11:22:15  18       any sense material.

11:22:17  19           Now, how Carey are going to prove the relevant

11:22:23  20       breaches is of course a matter for them.  But I imagine

11:22:29  21       that for practical purposes that the parties will

11:22:33  22       produce a Scott schedule or something of that sort.

11:22:35  23   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  That is the first mention of a Scott

11:22:37  24       schedule in any of the material I've seen.

11:22:40  25   MR McCALL:  My Lord, we have invited Carey to produce


                                            31
11:22:42   1       a first draft of a Scott schedule.

11:22:45   2   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Possibly, but it's the first time it's

11:22:47   3       been mentioned to the court.

11:22:48   4   MR McCALL:  No, indeed.  I think both parties were conscious

11:22:51   5       of the remarks you made on Thursday about the

11:22:53   6       practicality of decision-making when there are so many

11:22:56   7       small factual issues to be decided.

11:22:59   8   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Yes, well, I'm not sure a Scott schedule

11:23:02   9       will help much.

11:23:04  10   MR McCALL:  My Lord, what I had in mind -- but you may have

11:23:06  11       other ideas, and we are here to make sure that you have

11:23:14  12       something which is convenient -- was a schedule of some

11:23:15  13       sort which set out the particular allegations that Carey

11:23:16  14       felt it wanted to prove.  It would have a column saying

11:23:21  15       what evidence proved it, and then another column from

11:23:24  16       GHU to say what its case was on those matters.

11:23:27  17   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  How many pages would this schedule be?

11:23:30  18   MR McCALL:  Well, I don't know, but there must be 30 or 40

11:23:35  19       individual allegations or possibly more, so it could go

11:23:39  20       on for quite a few pages.

11:23:42  21   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Well, before I contemplate another

11:23:45  22       document, I want to know exactly what is being

11:23:51  23       suggested.

11:23:54  24   MR McCALL:  Well, my Lord, if I may leave it at that.  If

11:23:56  25       Carey want to say how they propose to prove these


                                            32
11:24:00   1       points, then you may want them to do that now.

11:24:03   2   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  I think, if you don't mind, I'll continue

11:24:06   3       with the opening.  It's a point that's explored in some

11:24:12   4       little detail in the skeleton arguments, so everybody

11:24:15   5       knows it's out there.

11:24:17   6   MR McCALL:  Yes.

11:24:24   7           My Lord, I mentioned going back now to schedule 3 of

11:24:27   8       the SPA on page 127 of bundle F3. {F3/3/127}

11:24:32   9   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Yes.

11:24:37  10   MR McCALL:  Paragraph 1.4 is concerned with the issue of

11:24:40  11       project certificates.

11:24:41  12   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Yes.

11:24:43  13   MR McCALL:  My Lord, I can take it quite quickly.

11:24:45  14       Paragraph (a) says that the EARs were to include details

11:24:50  15       of the costs that Urvasco shall have incurred in the

11:24:53  16       previous calendar month, and supporting information had

11:24:57  17       to be provided on request.  In (b) G&T were required to

11:25:01  18       review the development costs in respect of which

11:25:04  19       an advance was requested each month by checking the

11:25:07  20       amounts in the EARs, verifying that the work and

11:25:11  21       materials to which those costs related had been

11:25:14  22       performed, ordered and supplied.  That was a sort of

11:25:18  23       verification exercise for G&T.

11:25:20  24           And then (c), having done that, within five business

11:25:24  25       days of receipt of the EAR, G&T were to issue a project


                                            33
11:25:28   1       certificate stating the sum verified.

11:25:31   2           My Lord, so that sum verified might be less than the

11:25:36   3       amount claimed in any given month.  There was

11:25:39   4       a procedure for GHU to dispute the amounts stated, but

11:25:44   5       I needn't trouble you with that, it wasn't invoked.

11:25:48   6           My Lord, you will remember that in accordance with

11:25:51   7       clause 4 of the loan agreement the relevant tranche of

11:25:54   8       the loan to which a project certificate related was to

11:25:59   9       be available for drawdown three business days after

11:26:02  10       delivery of that project certificate.

11:26:08  11           My Lord, with that background, if we could go on to

11:26:10  12       look at what actually happened in and around 6 June, and

11:26:16  13       we will need some of the E bundles for that purpose.

11:26:19  14   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Well, I have my documents in the core

11:26:21  15       bundle, but you can give me the reference?

11:26:23  16   MR McCALL:  My Lord, if we could look at E33/12, {E33/12}

11:26:27  17       this is the letter of 19 May, or maybe an email.

11:26:34  18       Page 12.

11:26:48  19   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Just a moment.  The letter of 19 May?

11:26:51  20   MR McCALL:  Yes.  It's an email, my Lord.

11:26:57  21   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  What's the reference again?

11:27:00  22   MR McCALL:  It's page 12, E33, page 12.

11:27:26  23                             (Pause)

11:27:35  24   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Right.  It's page 658.  I will simply

11:27:40  25       dictate that into the transcript.


                                            34
11:27:42   1   MR McCALL:  Thank you, my Lord.

11:27:43   2           This is an email of 19 May from Jose Angel Fernandez

11:27:47   3       of IDOM to Mr Monti Molefe of Gardiner & Theobald.

11:27:55   4           I wanted to read the first line:

11:27:58   5           "Attached April 08 project certificate so you can

11:27:59   6       check it with Karl on site today."

11:28:02   7           I wanted to draw attention to those words.

11:28:05   8           The point is this, my Lord, that as it did every

11:28:08   9       month in advance of certifying a sum G&T would visit the

11:28:13  10       site and inspect progress, basically, and see what had

11:28:16  11       been done.  In respect of the April tranche, it did

11:28:21  12       indeed make its site inspection on that day, 19 May.

11:28:27  13       You can see, therefore, that when it did that it already

11:28:33  14       had in its possession the Employer's Agent Reports in

11:28:37  15       respect of which the claim for the April tranche was

11:28:39  16       made.

11:28:48  17           That EAR was then considered by G&T and they issued

11:28:52  18       a monitoring report.  My Lord, that is in the L bundles.

11:29:00  19       For present purposes you may not need to go there --

11:29:04  20   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  I will certainly have a look at it.

11:29:06  21   MR McCALL:  It's L1.1, volume 1. {L1.1/1}

11:29:09  22   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  What's the date of it?

11:29:16  23   MR McCALL:  My Lord, I'll just get that.  The report itself

11:29:19  24       is dated 18 May.  My Lord, I think it was sent on

11:29:22  25       19 May.


                                            35
11:29:26   1   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Right, and where is it in the core

11:29:28   2       bundle?  Perhaps Mr Smith could identify the page

11:29:31   3       reference for me.

11:29:35   4   MR McCALL:  My Lord, the report itself is in bundle L1.1.

11:29:40   5   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  There are approximately 200 bundles to my

11:29:43   6       left, you can see them.  If someone wants me to look at

11:29:49   7       something that's not in the core bundle, we will need to

11:29:52   8       find some way of doing that, and what I suggest

11:29:55   9       practically is that you have someone sitting down there

11:30:04  10       at the end, and they can go to the bundle and they can

11:30:14  11       pass the document to me, if it's not already in the core

11:30:15  12       bundle.

11:30:16  13   MR McCALL:  I am very grateful.

11:30:16  14   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Otherwise I'll be going to and fro.

11:30:17  15   MR McCALL:  Yes, I think that may become necessary shortly.

11:30:19  16   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Would you like to set that up, perhaps

11:30:21  17       when we have a short break?  Would that suit you?

11:30:24  18   MR McCALL:  Yes.

11:30:25  19   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  I have in mind the transcribers.

11:30:28  20   MR McCALL:  My Lord, we will certainly do that.

11:30:30  21   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  And I have a note from my clerk to remind

11:30:33  22       me not to leave them transcribing all morning without

11:30:37  23       a break.

11:30:38  24   MR McCALL:  My Lord, very good.

11:30:41  25   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Would this be a convenient time to raise


                                            36
11:30:43   1       the minor housekeeping points I do have?

11:30:46   2   MR McCALL:  Indeed it would, yes.

11:30:48   3   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Thank you.

11:30:48   4                           Housekeeping

11:30:50   5   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  It goes to the core bundle, and I am sure

11:30:53   6       the parties understand why I need it, and this goes

11:31:02   7       really to both parties, and they can sort it out, not

11:31:07   8       immediately but at some time, perhaps after court today.

11:31:13   9           There is an issue as to legibility as to some of the

11:31:17  10       documents, and I think I raised that by email on Friday.

11:31:23  11       You may not have seen it.  One thing I would like done,

11:31:28  12       for example, is my marked-up copies of the F3 and F4

11:31:34  13       documents put into the core bundle in place of what's

11:31:37  14       there already with the core bundle numbering on them.

11:31:41  15       That's the first thing.

11:31:43  16           Secondly, some of the letters in the core bundle are

11:31:47  17       incomplete.  I have in mind in particular the

11:31:50  18       Baker & McKenzie letters round about this time, but

11:31:53  19       there may be others.  Again, that's something that can

11:31:55  20       be checked, after court today will be absolutely fine.

11:32:02  21           Thirdly, there is a bit of pruning that could be

11:32:07  22       done.  One or two cases I have the same document twice,

11:32:12  23       but not very many.  There are formal bits at the end of

11:32:17  24       emails that sometimes take up a whole page, so if those

11:32:20  25       could go, that would be extremely helpful.


                                            37
11:32:22   1           Just from a practical point of view, so that we

11:32:27   2       don't waste time during the hearing when you have all

11:32:31   3       kinds of documents I am sure you want to refer to that

11:32:34   4       aren't in the core bundles at the moment, I suggest that

11:32:36   5       you have between you somebody who can sit down there,

11:32:44   6       there is a seat available, who can go to the bundle when

11:32:48   7       a reference is made and bring me the document and I'll

11:32:50   8       put it in the core bundle there and then.

11:32:52   9   MR McCALL:  Certainly.

11:32:53  10   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  I hope that will work.

11:32:59  11           Finally, so far as the core bundles are concerned,

11:33:02  12       additions to the core bundle must come through me at the

11:33:07  13       hearing, please, not out of hours added to my bundle;

11:33:11  14       I want to know what's there.

11:33:14  15   MR McCALL:  I see, thank you.

11:33:15  16   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  I will rise for a few minutes and resume

11:33:18  17       in about five minutes' time.

11:33:28  18   (11.35 am)

11:33:32  19                         (A short break)

11:42:18  20   (11.45 am)

11:43:11  21   MR McCALL:  My Lord, happily I have been able to do some

11:43:14  22       cross-referencing to the core bundle, so I hope for the

11:43:16  23       rest of this morning I will be able to give you core

11:43:19  24       bundle references.

11:43:20  25   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  That's very kind indeed.  I should say


                                            38
11:43:22   1       that I did also check Magnum in relation to the missing

11:43:27   2       pages, but I couldn't find them there either.  I am sure

11:43:30   3       they will appear before too long.

11:43:37   4   MR McCALL:  My Lord, yes.

11:43:37   5   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  I hope the person who is very kindly

11:43:40   6       sitting at the end there is all right.  You can't see

11:43:43   7       her, but I can.

11:43:44   8   MR McCALL:  There are only four or five references that Lucy

11:43:47   9       will need to get so I will shout them out when we get

11:43:48  10       there.

11:43:50  11   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Very well.

11:43:50  12           Opening submissions by MR McCALL (continued)

11:43:52  13   MR McCALL:  My Lord, can I ask you to go to your core

11:43:54  14       bundle 2, page 710, this is E36/17. {E36/17}

11:44:02  15   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Certainly.  Yes.

11:44:19  16   MR McCALL:  My Lord, this is Gardiner & Theobald's email of

11:44:22  17       3 June attaching the monitoring report and project

11:44:26  18       certificate for the April tranche, so 3 June is

11:44:28  19       obviously the date to note.

11:44:31  20   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Yes.

11:44:31  21   MR McCALL:  The monitoring report and certificate itself are

11:44:37  22       in your core bundle 2 at page 715, bundle L1.2/1.

11:44:44  23       {L1.2/1/137}

11:44:46  24   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Thank you very much indeed.

11:44:51  25   MR McCALL:  My Lord, I'll look at the report itself in


                                            39
11:44:54   1       detail later.  All you need to see for present purposes

11:44:59   2       is bundle page 137, internal page 10.

11:45:13   3   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Yes, thank you.

11:45:14   4   MR McCALL:  You can see at the top it says:

11:45:16   5           "G&T has analysed all the information supplied to

11:45:20   6       date and undertook a site walkabout to check the

11:45:20   7       contract progress.  On that basis G&T produced

11:45:23   8       a valuation attached to appendix B which recommends

11:45:26   9       payment by Losan for the sum of 2.258 million."

11:45:31  10           Then the calculation for that is set out below.

11:45:38  11           The actual valuation certificate itself is at

11:45:41  12       page 181 of the bundle.  {L1.2/1/181} I don't think

11:45:43  13       there is an internal page reference to that, but it's

11:45:46  14       three or four pages from the end.

11:45:52  15   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Thank you very much.  Yes.

11:45:53  16   MR McCALL:  You can see the valuation itself, that the same

11:45:54  17       figure in the bottom right which is 2.258 million, and

11:45:57  18       it's signed, which I think is Mr Farmiloe's signature.

11:46:04  19           So, my Lord, in accordance with clause 4(a)(ii) of

11:46:12  20       the loan agreement, the April tranche of 2.258 million

11:46:13  21       should therefore have been available for drawdown within

11:46:18  22       three business days.  June 3 was a Tuesday, so the April

11:46:24  23       tranche should have been available on Friday, 6 June,

11:46:27  24       and I don't think there is any dispute about the date of

11:46:30  25       6 June, but of course as you know the April tranche was


                                            40
11:46:32   1       not made available for drawdown on that day.

11:46:36   2           The reasons for that were explained in the 9 June

11:46:38   3       letter, that's bundle E37, and in the core bundle 3,

11:46:42   4       page 822.  {E37/175} Within the E bundle, it is

11:47:00   5       page 175.

11:47:03   6   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Yes.

11:47:04   7   MR McCALL:  My Lord, I will go through this in a little

11:47:06   8       detail.

11:47:07   9   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Just to get the point out of the way, is

11:47:11  10       there a better copy than I have at the moment?  It

11:47:21  11       doesn't greatly matter.

11:47:22  12   MR McCALL:  I am afraid I'm not aware of a better copy at

11:47:24  13       the moment.  We will certainly get you one.

11:47:24  14   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Everyone has a poor copy, do they?

11:47:28  15   MR McCALL:  Mine is perfectly legible, my Lord.  We will

11:47:31  16       make sure we get you a better copy, if that can possibly

11:47:34  17       be done.

11:47:35  18   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Yes.

11:47:37  19   MR McCALL:  My Lord, if in the meantime there are any

11:47:39  20       passages that you can't read as I go through it, please

11:47:41  21       say.

11:47:42  22   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  No, I can read it.

11:47:44  23   MR McCALL:  So the first page of the letter refers in the --

11:47:48  24   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Do you mind if I just check, while we are

11:47:51  25       at it, to see if there is a better copy.


                                            41
11:47:56   1                             (Pause)

11:47:59   2           One problem has been solved.  Right.

11:48:21   3   MR McCALL:  So halfway down the page there is a reference to

11:48:24   4       information which has come to our attention indicating

11:48:26   5       a substantial deterioration in the financial condition

11:48:29   6       and prospects of GHU, Urvasco and GU.  The reference

11:48:35   7       there near the holepunch is to the 2007 draft

11:48:40   8       consolidated financial statements for GHU.

11:48:43   9           Below that, there is a reference to some press

11:48:46  10       reports to the effect that GU was allegedly in

11:48:50  11       discussions with creditors, and that it was disposing of

11:48:52  12       substantial assets, and that apparently suppliers on

11:48:55  13       different sides had entered to reclaim some materials.

11:49:00  14           Importantly, at the bottom of the page, the last

11:49:03  15       three lines, for the purposes of a MAC, unarguably so in

11:49:09  16       the case of GHU and Urvasco, the comparison that has to

11:49:11  17       be made is between the position at the end of

11:49:15  18       December 2007 and the position as at 6 June 2008 when

11:49:19  19       the April tranche was due.  So that's the comparison

11:49:23  20       that would have to be made under the contract.  Whereas

11:49:26  21       in fact at the bottom of that page, the comparison that

11:49:28  22       is made is between GHU's draft consolidated accounts to

11:49:33  23       31 December 2007 and the position as at

11:49:36  24       31 December 2006.  So on any basis that is plainly the

11:49:43  25       wrong test.


                                            42
11:49:46   1           Then at the top of the next page, {E37/176} three

11:49:49   2       lines down, having referred to the figures in those

11:49:53   3       financial statements and accounts, it says:

11:49:55   4           "This figures [it presumably means 'these figures',

11:49:59   5       ie the wrong figures] casual significant doubt on the

11:50:03   6       ability of GHU to fund the balance of costs."

11:50:06   7           That's the only reason given in this letter to cast

11:50:09   8       doubt on the question of whether the development could

11:50:12   9       be completed by the long stop date.  So you see that

11:50:15  10       from the next couple of lines.  It's said that there is

11:50:18  11       basically a funding problem, and that's the only point

11:50:22  12       in this letter taken about the ability to complete by

11:50:24  13       the long stop date, a point is not taken by failure to

11:50:27  14       provide information, late payment and all that sort of

11:50:32  15       thing, and nothing about existing delays of which, on

11:50:35  16       any case, Gardiner & Theobald and therefore Carey were

11:50:39  17       well aware, and we will see that later.

11:50:43  18           Then in the middle of the page, between the hole

11:50:45  19       punches, it says that the information indicates, and it

11:50:48  20       sets out (a), (b) and (c), that GHU may be in breach,

11:50:55  21       BBVA default may have arisen, practical completion is

11:50:58  22       not realistically achievable.

11:51:01  23           These on GHU's case were merely expressions of

11:51:05  24       suspicion, they are certainly not clear allegations of

11:51:08  25       default.


                                            43
11:51:10   1           My Lord, just one final point: at the top of

11:51:17   2       page 177, {E38/177} you will see that Losan say:

11:51:24   3           "We are keen to establish whether completion on the

11:51:26   4       project prior to the long stop date remains viable."

11:51:29   5           That was the tone.  It's a letter of enquiry, not

11:51:32   6       a letter of expression of loan default.

11:51:42   7           My Lord, I don't have time now to take you through

11:51:44   8       the correspondence which followed.  It's summarised in

11:51:47   9       GHU's written submissions, paragraphs 31 to 42.  In

11:51:54  10       short, you will probably have seen from your pre-reading

11:51:57  11       that GHU refuted those allegations, Cesar Losada, who is

11:52:05  12       effectively the person running Carey at that time,

11:52:08  13       sought to encourage GHU to agree an accelerated

11:52:11  14       acquisition of Urvasco by Carey.

11:52:15  15           GHU, over the next few weeks, provided a great deal

11:52:19  16       of financial information that had been requested, but

11:52:22  17       from its perspective, from GHU's perspective,

11:52:26  18       Cesar Losada and Carey kept moving the goalposts.

11:52:37  19           My Lord, I will take you to a couple of examples,

11:52:37  20       there are some clear signs in this period that Carey was

11:52:38  21       blowing hot and cold, that it was perhaps telling GHU

11:52:41  22       one thing and doing another.  In short, it was leading

11:52:45  23       GHU up the garden path.

11:52:51  24           My Lord, if we could look at first an email of

11:52:53  25       4 June, it's in your core bundle 3 at 786, it's E36,


                                            44
11:52:58   1       page 156. {E36/156}

11:53:09   2   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  What page, I am sorry?

11:53:11   3   MR McCALL:  Core bundle 786.  My Lord, I think it may be

11:53:32   4       core bundle 2, I may have misled you there.  It's

11:53:35   5       page 786.

11:53:43   6   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Right, thank you.

11:53:44   7   MR McCALL:  So this is an email of 4 June.  My Lord, just to

11:53:48   8       remind you, that's just before the April tranche was

11:53:50   9       due, the IDOM EAR having already been delivered.  This

11:53:59  10       is Cesar Losada writing to Rafael Garcia Tapia saying in

11:54:03  11       the second sentence that we have stopped paying the

11:54:03  12       certifications until they, that's GHU, clarified the

11:54:08  13       situation.

11:54:08  14           So that's a clear statement of what they had

11:54:11  15       determined at that point.  Yet, my Lord, if you go in

11:54:15  16       your same bundle to your page 774, or in E36 to

11:54:19  17       page 130, {E36/130} we see at the top of that page

11:54:30  18       an email from Jose Angel Fernandez of IDOM to people at

11:54:39  19       Urvasco or Grupo Urvasco saying this:

11:54:44  20           "I agreed with Rafael [this is the same day] that I

11:54:48  21       would send him the email below for him to use so as to

11:54:50  22       apply a measure of pressure in his own company in order

11:54:52  23       to expedite the payment."

11:54:54  24           Then below that there is the email that was used for

11:54:56  25       that purpose, which is a sort of plea for quick payment,


                                            45
11:55:01   1       if I can put it that way.  So it seems, if these

11:55:04   2       documents are to be believed, that Mr Garcia Tapia at

11:55:08   3       that point was playing sort of good cop/bad cop role

11:55:14   4       telling Jose Angel Fernandez one thing and doing

11:55:17   5       something very different.

11:55:19   6           I'll give one other example of that sort of

11:55:22   7       behaviour, but there are many.  My Lord, in your bundle,

11:55:27   8       core 3/1094, or in E54/195. {E54/195}

11:56:01   9   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  1094?

11:56:03  10   MR McCALL:  Yes, it's your 1094.  So here in the middle of

11:56:20  11       the page, between the holepunches, I hope you have

11:56:24  12       an email of 8 August from Mr Garcia Tapia to

11:56:31  13       Monti Molefe of G&T:

11:56:34  14           "Monti, there is no need to answer Jose Angel's

11:56:37  15       email until next week."

11:56:37  16           That is the email at the bottom of the page querying

11:56:38  17       the project certificate.

11:56:40  18           "We need to gain time for our negotiations and they

11:56:47  19       are starting to get nervous.  Thank you."

11:56:50  20           My Lord, that seems to capture in a nutshell what

11:56:57  21       Carey were doing at that time.  Their real agenda was to

11:57:01  22       put serious financial pressure on GHU so that Carey's

11:57:06  23       own negotiating position in seeking to agree

11:57:10  24       an accelerated purchase of Urvasco would be improved.

11:57:28  25           My Lord, if we can now quickly complete the


                                            46
11:57:31   1       sequence, and for that you need your core bundle 3,

11:57:37   2       page 1102, I need E57, page 17.  {E57/17} I hope you

11:57:58   3       have a letter of 15 August from Mayer Brown to

11:58:02   4       Baker & McKenzie, who were then acting for GHU.

11:58:08   5       Mayer Brown wrote to Baker & McKenzie on that date

11:58:11   6       alleging an interest default, and you will see at the

11:58:14   7       bottom of the page they were still, on behalf of Carey,

11:58:18   8       pressing for accelerated completion of the SPA.

11:58:27   9           My Lord, if you would then turn to page 1105 of your

11:58:31  10       core bundle 3, page 68 of E57, {E57/68} at the bottom of

11:58:46  11       the page Baker & McKenzie responded on 19 August:

11:58:49  12           "As agreed between Losan and GHU, GHU has today made

11:58:54  13       payment of the outstanding interest under the loan

11:58:57  14       agreement which was due to be paid on 8 August, and

11:58:59  15       understand on this basis Losan will now remedy its

11:59:04  16       default under the loan agreement caused by its failure

11:59:05  17       to advance the April tranche."

11:59:06  18           Then on the next page, {E57/69} they requested

11:59:09  19       payment of the other subsequent tranches which by then

11:59:12  20       had become outstanding, and I'll take you to that in

11:59:14  21       a minute.  As you know, nothing was paid.  By this time,

11:59:20  22       my Lord, it was becoming rapidly clear to GHU that Carey

11:59:23  23       had no intention of honouring its obligations, and as

11:59:28  24       I said earlier, was only leading GHU up the garden path

11:59:32  25       and playing for time in order to put pressure on it.


                                            47
11:59:35   1           Now, my Lord --

11:59:37   2   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Playing for time for what, though?

11:59:40   3   MR McCALL:  Time so that the pressure financially would

11:59:44   4       increase on GHU, enabling Carey to better its

11:59:48   5       negotiating position relating to the discussions for

11:59:52   6       accelerated purchase of Urvasco.

11:59:59   7           Now, I mentioned, my Lord, that by this time several

12:00:03   8       other tranches of the loan were due and had been

12:00:06   9       certified as such by GHU.  That position is summarised

12:00:09  10       in GHU's opening submissions at page 61 of the bundle,

12:00:17  11       my Lord, I'll give you the internal reference, it's

12:00:19  12       paragraph 58, and it's internal page 16 of our

12:00:29  13       submissions.  You can see from that -- if you have that

12:00:40  14       table, my Lord -- that the first figure of 2.258 million

12:00:51  15       is the April certification, and then for the subsequent

12:00:52  16       months other sums were certified for May, June and July.

12:00:54  17       I'll address you later about the level of those

12:00:58  18       certifications.  As you can see, other tranches were

12:01:01  19       due, at least on GHU's case.

12:01:08  20           My Lord, just to finish the story, on 6 October

12:01:12  21       Carey gave notice of cancellation of the loan agreement,

12:01:15  22       that's in your core bundle at 1179.  GHU nevertheless

12:01:21  23       continued to explore the various possibilities,

12:01:23  24       including the question of whether an alternative funder

12:01:26  25       could be found.


                                            48
12:01:27   1           My Lord, as I submitted earlier, it was to

12:01:30   2       facilitate that that the parties entered the standstill

12:01:34   3       agreement on 21 October 2008, in bundle F5.

12:01:40   4           My Lord, as you know, that unfortunately did not

12:01:42   5       result in a solution.  Ultimately, as you know, BBVA

12:01:48   6       appointed a receiver on 28 July 2009, and on 29 December

12:01:54   7       2009 GHU rescinded the SPA, and your reference is core

12:02:01   8       bundle 4/1376.  Finally, on the next day,

12:02:07   9       30 December 2009, the building was sold by the receiver.

12:02:12  10           Now, my Lord, you have heard in my submissions the

12:02:16  11       importance of issues of materiality, and many of those

12:02:20  12       go to the question of whether the defaults alleged by

12:02:23  13       Carey would have had an impact on the ability of Urvasco

12:02:26  14       to complete the development by the long stop date.  So

12:02:30  15       that's the question that I am going to address next;

12:02:36  16       important because it underlies so many other issues.

12:02:39  17           My Lord, to do that, can I ask you to go to

12:02:44  18       appendix 5 to Carey's written opening submissions.  In

12:03:06  19       this short appendix, Carey identify ten alleged defaults

12:03:14  20       or species of default relating to the development which

12:03:17  21       it said justified its failure to advance the April

12:03:21  22       tranche or any further subsequent tranches after that.

12:03:27  23           My Lord, if I can run through that list quickly in

12:03:30  24       order to highlight the significance of the materiality

12:03:31  25       issues which I have touched on several times, the


                                            49
12:03:36   1       question being in other words: can Carey rely on other

12:03:39   2       defaults or only defaults which are material?

12:03:42   3           My Lord, taking first the issue in paragraph 2.1,

12:03:46   4       which is the failure to inform G&T of breaches of

12:03:50   5       development documents, that's principally related on

12:03:54   6       Carey's case to late payment of contractors.  Now, you

12:03:57   7       will note at the end of paragraph 2.1, last line and

12:04:02   8       a bit, Carey say that:

12:04:05   9           "This is a default under clause 10(b)(iii) of the

12:04:08  10       loan agreement."

12:04:09  11           My Lord, that is one of the default provisions that

12:04:13  12       has the express materiality threshold.  However, in

12:04:19  13       respect of the same alleged breaches under the SPA,

12:04:24  14       Carey in the earlier part of this paragraph relies on

12:04:29  15       breach of schedule 3, clause 1.3(c)(i), and

12:04:34  16       clause 11(b)(ii) of the loan agreement, which is the one

12:04:38  17       that relates to the SPA.  As you have seen, neither of

12:04:41  18       those provisions have any express materiality threshold.

12:04:47  19       But since they relate to the same, effectively, breaches

12:04:50  20       or breaches which are factually the same, GHU argues

12:04:55  21       that either as a matter of construction or implied terms

12:04:58  22       and under Spanish law in the case of the loan agreement,

12:05:01  23       the defaults had to be material in order to be acted

12:05:04  24       upon.

12:05:05  25           Then paragraphs 2.2 and 2.3 below that, they are


                                            50
12:05:12   1       both sets of allegations concerned with the same factual

12:05:15   2       material, namely alleged deficiencies in the Employer's

12:05:18   3       Agent Reports for April, May and June.

12:05:23   4           If we could take the second of those first, 2.3,

12:05:26   5       there Carey is relying on breaches of the representation

12:05:30   6       in clause 8(k) and the default under 10(b)(iii) of the

12:05:37   7       loan agreement, and those are provisions which have

12:05:39   8       express materiality thresholds, and yet if we look at

12:05:43   9       2.2 in respect of the same EARs, here Carey is relying

12:05:48  10       on the SPA schedule 3-clause 1.3(a) and the

12:05:53  11       corresponding clause in the loan agreement, which is

12:05:56  12       10(b)(ii) and, as I mentioned, those provisions do not

12:06:01  13       say in terms that a default has to be material, so my

12:06:04  14       same submission applies there.

12:06:07  15           Same point in paragraph 2.4, this is failure to

12:06:09  16       procure that Urvasco provided certain documents to G&T.

12:06:15  17       GHU says on the facts that no breach arose anyway.  But

12:06:18  18       in any event, to qualify as a default under the loan

12:06:21  19       agreement, any breach of paragraph 1.4 would have to be

12:06:25  20       material.

12:06:27  21           Then over the page, my Lord, paragraphs 2.5 and 2.6,

12:06:32  22       they are concerned with completion by the long stop

12:06:34  23       date.  They give rise to slightly different

12:06:39  24       consideration, I suppose, GHU's case simply being that

12:06:43  25       the development would have been completed by the long


                                            51
12:06:45   1       stop date, and there is no reason for it to have

12:06:47   2       believed otherwise, so a different point arises.

12:06:51   3           2.7, this is an allegation concerned with alleged

12:06:55   4       failures to notify Carey about claims.  At the end of

12:07:00   5       that paragraph, the last couple of lines, you can see

12:07:02   6       Carey relies on clause 10(b)(iii) of the loan agreement,

12:07:06   7       which is one of those with the express materiality

12:07:13   8       threshold, and yet in the first part of that paragraph

12:07:14   9       Carey relies on the SPA, schedule 3, clause 1.3(c)(i)

12:07:17  10       and the corresponding 10(b)(ii) in the loan agreement.

12:07:21  11       I make the same point again.

12:07:24  12           Finally paragraphs 2 .8 to 2.10, they deal with

12:07:28  13       different types of default under the intercreditor

12:07:28  14       agreement --

12:07:28  15   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  You say the same point?

12:07:30  16   MR McCALL:  -- but it's the same point.

12:07:32  17   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Yes, but the point you say is that it

12:07:35  18       would be odd if it was material for one purpose but not

12:07:39  19       for the other.

12:07:41  20   MR McCALL:  Yes.

12:07:44  21           My Lord, completion by the long stop date is

12:07:47  22       addressed in appendix 4 to GHU's opening submission, and

12:07:53  23       the issue of delay, which is effectively what it

12:07:57  24       addresses, is an issue of very great importance in this

12:07:59  25       case.  Specifically of course the question is whether


                                            52
12:08:03   1       practical completion of the development was likely to

12:08:05   2       have been achieved by the long stop date, and as I have

12:08:10   3       submitted, that issue underlies many other matters

12:08:14   4       relating to materiality which I have mentioned.

12:08:20   5           Plainly the burden of proving both the fact of

12:08:26   6       completion not being likely to be achieved and the

12:08:29   7       question of materiality, if I am right about that, lies

12:08:31   8       with Carey.  Perhaps it was with that burden of proof in

12:08:35   9       mind that it was Carey who, in February of this year,

12:08:41  10       made a belated application which was heard by

12:08:44  11       Mr Justice Eder for permission to adduce expert

12:08:49  12       programming and planning evidence.  That application was

12:08:53  13       granted, hence the reports from Mr Chamberlain and

12:08:56  14       Mr Saulsbury.

12:09:03  15           My Lord, given that background and given the

12:09:05  16       importance of the issue, you may think it surprising

12:09:08  17       that the question of whether the long stop date would

12:09:11  18       have been achieved actually occupies relatively little

12:09:15  19       space in Carey's written opening submissions.  Instead

12:09:18  20       they concentrate on factual matters about late payments,

12:09:22  21       for example, and about information they say was not

12:09:24  22       provided, but they don't link it to questions of long

12:09:29  23       stop date and the ability of Urvasco to meet that date.

12:09:38  24           My Lord, I will take you in due course to some of

12:09:41  25       the conclusions that Mr Saulsbury -- that's GHU's


                                            53
12:09:45   1       expert -- reaches.  I need to mention a few concepts

12:09:48   2       first.

12:09:49   3           The first is the idea of programmes in construction

12:09:51   4       contracts, and you have several bundles full of

12:09:55   5       programmes to which I hope not very much reference will

12:09:58   6       be made.

12:09:59   7           The IDOM person who was in charge of that side of

12:10:02   8       things, as you have seen, was Miguel Utrilla.  He used

12:10:07   9       computer software to run the computer programmes, it's

12:10:12  10       one of the frequently used types called Microsoft

12:10:15  11       Project, and there were three types of programme that he

12:10:19  12       used.  He used a long-term programme, they were all

12:10:25  13       programmes which show the main activities on the

12:10:29  14       programme, and which forecast the completion date for

12:10:31  15       the whole development.  He also used short-term

12:10:38  16       programmes which were more detailed, they showed

12:10:40  17       a snapshot in time showing the works that had recently

12:10:44  18       been carried out, and those planned to be carried out in

12:10:47  19       the near future.  They were used to manage everyday

12:10:51  20       works.  Then there were contractor programmes, which

12:10:54  21       were the individual programmes produced by the

12:10:57  22       particular trade contractors.  The information in those

12:11:01  23       three types of programmes fed into each other.

12:11:05  24           The second point which you may have read about in

12:11:09  25       our opening submissions is the critical path.  My Lord,


                                            54
12:11:11   1       the critical path of a building project refers to a set

12:11:17   2       of activities which at any given time control the date

12:11:21   3       when a project will be completed.  The point is that not

12:11:26   4       every activity that's going on at a given point in time,

12:11:30   5       if delayed, would actually cause the end date of the

12:11:33   6       plan to be delayed.

12:11:35   7           I think the example we give in our written

12:11:38   8       submissions would be a house is being built and the roof

12:11:40   9       still hadn't been finished.  Well, the fact that someone

12:11:44  10       else was working on the skirting board downstairs and

12:11:48  11       was a bit late with that would not be a critical delay

12:11:49  12       when the thing that would really hold up the completion

12:11:51  13       of the project would be getting the roof on.  That's

12:11:54  14       an example of a delayed difficulty, skirting boards,

12:11:58  15       which was not critical, because it wouldn't actually

12:12:01  16       hold up the end date.

12:12:03  17           Now, in the present case, an important part of the

12:12:08  18       analysis that the experts have carried out is to

12:12:08  19       identify what the critical path was up until

12:12:13  20       6 June 2008, because it's by doing that that the actual

12:12:19  21       delays can be assessed in terms of their importance to

12:12:23  22       the question of whether or not they would have caused

12:12:26  23       the end delivery of the hotel itself to be delayed.

12:12:32  24           The critical path up to the principal date that you

12:12:35  25       are concerned with, which is 6 June 2008, lay in the


                                            55
12:12:39   1       superstructure works of the building.  So that means the

12:12:43   2       structural steel frame, it was one of those buildings

12:12:46   3       which you see going up all over London, which is

12:12:49   4       basically a solid steel frame onto which everything else

12:12:53   5       is then attached.  So it makes sense that at that stage

12:12:56   6       the structural steel frame was the critical activity.

12:13:01   7           There are two other major structural elements

12:13:04   8       associated with that.  The first is the steel frame, the

12:13:07   9       second was the pre-cast concrete planks, those are great

12:13:12  10       big concrete bars which are laid onto the structural

12:13:17  11       steel, forming the floor slabs.

12:13:25  12           Then the third structural element was the so-called

12:13:27  13       concrete topping, and that's wet concrete that is poured

12:13:27  14       onto those slabs, onto the pre-cast concrete planks,

12:13:32  15       which bind the whole lot together and form a solid

12:13:36  16       superstructure.

12:13:37  17           Up until 6 June of course there were all sorts of

12:13:40  18       other activities going on at the same time as these

12:13:42  19       activities, but they were not on the critical path.

12:13:45  20       What was critical was getting the superstructure up and

12:13:48  21       finished.

12:13:53  22           The third concept I wanted to talk about, if I may,

12:13:57  23       is that of programme management, and this is about

12:14:02  24       planning.

12:14:03  25   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Just give me the names of the three


                                            56
12:14:06   1       contractors, so they are conveniently against those

12:14:09   2       three items.

12:14:11   3   MR McCALL:  Yes.  We are only concerned with two, actually.

12:14:14   4       The concrete works, which are the concrete planks and

12:14:16   5       the concrete topping, were Knight Build, and the

12:14:21   6       structural steel was Rowen.

12:14:22   7   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Thank you.

12:14:28   8   MR McCALL:  So programme management.  Now, my Lord, if you

12:14:32   9       have had a chance to look at Mr Utrilla and

12:14:34  10       Mr Jose Angel Fernandez's statements, you will see how

12:14:40  11       they have explained how the process of managing a job

12:14:42  12       like this is a dynamic one.  Programmes have to be

12:14:45  13       regularly amended to reflect the inevitable changes to

12:14:50  14       planned activities that constantly occur during a job.

12:14:54  15       So I mean, matters --

12:14:57  16   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  What number did they get up to in the

12:15:00  17       end?

12:15:01  18   MR McCALL:  They got up to 20.  My Lord, that's the 20

12:15:04  19       long-term programmes.  Between each iteration of the

12:15:08  20       long-term programmes, any number of small changes might

12:15:12  21       be made in short-term programmes and were made.  Changes

12:15:18  22       of that sort would happen all the time and would on any

12:15:22  23       large construction project.  They might relate to

12:15:25  24       matters such as simple things like bad weather.  If

12:15:29  25       an activity that is weather dependent is held up longer


                                            57
12:15:31   1       than planned, then changes have to be made, and this

12:15:34   2       always happens.  There might be small changes or

12:15:37   3       variations to the nature of the work that had to be

12:15:40   4       done.  And more pertinently for present purposes, there

12:15:45   5       might be delays, one or more or multiple contractors may

12:15:50   6       be delayed in starting or finishing their activities, in

12:15:54   7       which case the programme would have to be juggled around

12:15:57   8       and that might mean, for example, planning activities

12:16:00   9       which previously had been planned to take place

12:16:03  10       sequentially, one after the other, to take place in part

12:16:08  11       simultaneously.  On a site of this sort, multiple floors

12:16:15  12       and a large site, that's not often a problem.

12:16:18  13       Activities can go on in multiple places at multiple

12:16:21  14       times.

12:16:22  15           They are all reasons why programmes might have to be

12:16:24  16       amended during the course of works.  The point I really

12:16:29  17       wanted to get across is that that sort of revision and

12:16:32  18       resequencing is absolutely the norm for a job for a sort

12:16:37  19       and it is not a cause for alarm.  That was specifically

12:16:41  20       what Mr Miguel Utrilla's job was, and it is in that

12:16:46  21       context important to remember what his imperatives were,

12:16:50  22       the greatest being that he knew, as did the whole IDOM

12:16:56  23       team, that the job had to be finished by the long stop

12:16:59  24       date, if not before.  So whatever resequencing or

12:17:05  25       rejuggling or acceleration of works that would take


                                            58
12:17:08   1       place, ultimately what had to be done was meeting the

12:17:11   2       long stop date.  Urvasco and GHU have made it clear that

12:17:16   3       they would have instructed IDOM to take whatever steps

12:17:21   4       were necessary to ensure that this was achieved.

12:17:26   5           My Lord, when trying to analyse where delay has

12:17:29   6       happened and when it has happened on a project, you need

12:17:32   7       a starting point against which to measure where there

12:17:35   8       has been delay, and the starting point is the original

12:17:38   9       plan or the baseline against which future works were

12:17:42  10       planned.

12:17:44  11           Now, my Lord, a baseline programme is prepared at

12:17:46  12       an early stage in a project.  It represents the planned

12:17:50  13       intention for carrying out the works, and it includes

12:17:53  14       a forecast as at the date of the baseline for when the

12:17:58  15       works would be completed.  My Lord, Mr Saulsbury has

12:18:05  16       considered what is the baseline programme in this case,

12:18:07  17       and he explains for reasons in paragraphs 4.10 to 4.21

12:18:12  18       of his first report -- which I don't think we need go to

12:18:15  19       now -- why he selected revision long-term plan 15 of

12:18:21  20       September 2006.  So it's a very early document, and he

12:18:28  21       has, for the reasons he says --

12:18:31  22   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  When was the demolition finished?

12:18:35  23   MR McCALL:  December 2006.

12:18:41  24           Now, my Lord, float is another concept we need to

12:18:46  25       bear in mind.  Float is the spare time that's often


                                            59
12:18:49   1       built into a construction programme, and it's built in

12:18:52   2       to allow for the sort of slippage, the sort of delays

12:18:55   3       which almost always happen.  The point of it is to allow

12:19:01   4       for that delay without causing critical delay to

12:19:04   5       whatever the chosen target date or end date is.

12:19:07   6           My Lord, we need to look at Mr Saulsbury's first

12:19:11   7       report to see what float was available in this case.

12:19:13   8       It's bundle 6.2, volume 1. {D6.2/1/25}

12:19:47   9           Can I ask you to turn to page 25 of the bundle,

12:19:55  10       please.  I hope you have a chart on that page at the

12:20:05  11       top?  It's bundle number 25, internal 22.

12:20:12  12   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Yes, thank you.

12:20:12  13   MR McCALL:  The top half of the page is occupied by

12:20:14  14       a programme, and as you see the heading is "Summary of

12:20:17  15       LTP Revision (September 2006)".  As I said earlier,

12:20:22  16       that's the baseline programme, the programme against

12:20:24  17       which future delay is measured.

12:20:27  18           Actually this is a simplified version of what is

12:20:30  19       otherwise really rather a complex programme which is in

12:20:34  20       the other bundles.  Mr Saulsbury has simply simplified

12:20:38  21       the various activities and condensed them into the lines

12:20:41  22       that you see on this programme.

12:20:44  23           What it shows is the planned duration of

12:20:49  24       construction activities as at September 2006.  The green

12:20:58  25       lines which run across the page all represent different


                                            60
12:21:01   1       categories of construction work.  So the top one is

12:21:05   2       "West Core Works", the next one is "Superstructure Works

12:21:10   3       Hotel Area", "Superstructure Works Residential Area" is

12:21:14   4       next, and so on.  They are different groups of

12:21:16   5       activities.

12:21:18   6           Taking an example, say the fifth line down, which is

12:21:24   7       called "Facade Works", if you can see that, it shows

12:21:27   8       that the starting date for those works was planned to be

12:21:30   9       23/11, you can just see that number, I hope.  In other

12:21:35  10       words, the starting date for facade works was planned to

12:21:35  11       be 23 November 2007.  The finish, if you follow that

12:21:44  12       line across to the right, for that activity, facade

12:21:48  13       works, was planned to be 24/9, in other words

12:21:53  14       24 September 2008.

12:21:59  15           Now, if you look to the right-hand end of all those

12:22:05  16       green lines, you can see that the last two which were

12:22:08  17       planned to be finished were planned to finish on

12:22:11  18       18 December 2008, and they were the long green line in

12:22:17  19       the middle of the page, which is called MEP, that means

12:22:22  20       mechanical, electrical and plumbing.  If you go to the

12:22:26  21       right-hand of that line, you can just see the date

12:22:28  22       18/12, in other words that activity was due to finish on

12:22:33  23       18 December, and the finishing item would be the last

12:22:35  24       bit that you would do on plumbing, which would probably

12:22:38  25       be checking that the boiler works or something like


                                            61
12:22:40   1       that, commissioning or something of that sort.

12:22:45   2   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  This has got in the long stop date for

12:22:46   3       illustrative purposes?

12:22:48   4   MR McCALL:  Yes.  I'll explain that in a moment.

12:22:50   5   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  What was understood about contractual

12:22:51   6       completion at this point in time?

12:22:56   7   MR McCALL:  Sorry, my Lord, I don't understand.

12:22:57   8   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Under the Banco Bilbao contract, for

12:23:00   9       example.

12:23:03  10   MR McCALL:  My Lord, it's always the long stop date.

12:23:05  11   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  It has been the same long stop date, has

12:23:06  12       it?

12:23:07  13   MR McCALL:  Yes.  My Lord, I'll check that, because I see

12:23:13  14       heads shaking on the other side.  What certainly

12:23:17  15       happened is different target dates existed at different

12:23:21  16       times, and they changed from time to time.  But my

12:23:24  17       understanding is contractually the long stop date

12:23:27  18       remained the same, but we will check that position.

12:23:30  19           So, my Lord, the two activities I was looking at are

12:23:34  20       MEP, mechanical, electrical and plumbing, and then

12:23:37  21       slightly below that, three lines below that is a line

12:23:41  22       that says "Interior Fit-Out -- Hotel Area" and you can

12:23:44  23       see that too was planned to finish on 18 December 2008.

12:23:50  24           So it was those two activities, the last two which

12:23:54  25       were planned to finish, which dictated the overall


                                            62
12:23:58   1       planned completion date as at September 2006, namely

12:24:02   2       18 December 2008.

12:24:06   3           Now, given that the long stop date, unless it was

12:24:10   4       extended, was 30 April 2009, that meant that there was

12:24:15   5       a 19 week period of spare time or float between the

12:24:18   6       planned completion of those activities on 18 December

12:24:23   7       and the long stop date.  So that's a 19 week float,

12:24:28   8       which is shown in red and with a red flag on that

12:24:32   9       illustration.  That was the float that was built in, the

12:24:37  10       safety valve if you want to call it that, to this

12:24:41  11       baseline programme.

12:24:44  12           My Lord, what does that mean?  Well, if you look in

12:24:48  13       the paragraph below the chart in Mr Saulsbury's report,

12:24:52  14       paragraph 4.19, the last four lines, he says this:

12:24:57  15           "That 19 week period meant that the programme could

12:25:00  16       accommodate/absorb up to 19 weeks of delay before the

12:25:03  17       completion of the development would be delayed beyond

12:25:04  18       the long stop date, save for any subsequent acceleration

12:25:09  19       or mitigation measures to recover or offset the delay."

12:25:12  20           What he means by that is even if the delay looked

12:25:14  21       like causing the long stop date to go -- not to be met,

12:25:22  22       there could even in that situation be acceleration or

12:25:26  23       mitigation to prevent that from happening.

12:25:29  24           My Lord, the principal issue, as you know, in these

12:25:32  25       proceedings is whether or not there was a default as at


                                            63
12:25:34   1       6 June 2008.  With that in mind, Mr Saulsbury's next

12:25:41   2       step was to measure the actual critical delay as at that

12:25:44   3       date, as at 6 June, when compared with the baseline

12:25:47   4       programme.  So, my Lord, we need the same bundle at

12:25:53   5       bundle page 31, which is internal page 28. {D6.2/1/31}

12:26:09   6           My Lord, I think I can promise you this is the

12:26:11   7       second and final chart I am going to show you this

12:26:13   8       morning.  This is the results of Mr Saulsbury's exercise

12:26:19   9       of measuring the actual critical delay as compared to

12:26:27  10       the baseline programme.

12:26:28  11           So the green line near the top of this chart, that

12:26:30  12       is a summary representation of what we have just looked

12:26:33  13       at on the baseline programme, in other words it

12:26:34  14       represented the planned dates for the critical

12:26:40  15       superstructure activities which are shown there, and the

12:26:45  16       dates which are inherent in that green line are those

12:26:48  17       which are shown on the baseline programme, in other

12:26:51  18       words LTP 15 of September 2006.  So that's a planned

12:26:57  19       line.

12:26:59  20           The blue line below that is the actual line, that

12:27:02  21       represents the actual dates on which those same works

12:27:05  22       were completed.  So this is a comparison between planned

12:27:11  23       and actual.  What work was actually carried out, as

12:27:14  24       shown in the blue line, that's simply a matter of

12:27:17  25       record, my Lord, I don't think there is likely to be any


                                            64
12:27:20   1       dispute about that.  It can be seen readily from

12:27:24   2       programme 20, which records the actual dates for

12:27:28   3       completion of work.

12:27:31   4           My Lord, if you look at the bottom blue line, about

12:27:37   5       three-quarters of the way along it, you can see that

12:27:39   6       a date appears just above it of 2/6, and there is

12:27:45   7       a little box pointing towards that that says "Level 7

12:27:49   8       (Residential) & 8 (Hotel) Concrete Topping Complete".

12:27:54   9   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  No, I am sorry, I'm not following that.

12:27:56  10   MR McCALL:  My Lord, the bottom blue line, if you look along

12:27:59  11       it, three-quarters of its length towards the right you

12:28:02  12       can see in small lettering there is a little blue arrow

12:28:06  13       and the date 2/6.

12:28:08  14   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Yes.

12:28:09  15   MR McCALL:  There is a box with an arrow pointing to that

12:28:12  16       which says "Level 7 (Residential) & 8 (Hotel) Concrete

12:28:15  17       Topping Complete".

12:28:18  18   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Yes.

12:28:19  19   MR McCALL:  What that means is that on 2 June 2008, in other

12:28:22  20       words just before the relevant date of 6 June, the

12:28:25  21       concrete topping was completed on the residential and

12:28:29  22       hotel sides at that level.

12:28:33  23           Now, if you look at the green line above it, you can

12:28:36  24       compare the actual date for that activity with what was

12:28:39  25       planned for that activity, and you can do that by


                                            65
12:28:43   1       following the dotted red line up, where you can see that

12:28:47   2       the planned date for completion of that activity was

12:28:52   3       13/3, in other words 13 March 2008.  So in other words,

12:29:00   4       what we see from this --

12:29:02   5   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  What's written underneath that?

12:29:06   6   MR McCALL:  It says "R and H", which means "residential and

12:29:09   7       hotel".

12:29:10   8   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Thank you.

12:29:12   9   MR McCALL:  So what we see from that is that between the

12:29:17  10       planned date for completion of that activity, which was

12:29:20  11       13 March, and the actual date for completion of that

12:29:25  12       activity, which was 2 June, there was a delay of 81 days

12:29:31  13       or 11.6 weeks.  That's marked in red on that plan.

12:29:37  14       That's the significant date, because it shows the

12:29:40  15       critical delay to the superstructure activities, the

12:29:43  16       green line representing superstructure.

12:29:48  17           What Mr Saulsbury explains, and we can look at

12:29:51  18       paragraph 5.12 for this -- my Lord, this goes on for

12:29:59  19       a couple more pages -- between paragraphs 5.12 and 5.14,

12:30:04  20       he explains that that figure of delay, namely

12:30:07  21       11.6 weeks, is in fact the top end of a possible range

12:30:10  22       of delay, it overstates the delay, because it doesn't

12:30:13  23       take account of the resequencing, in other words the

12:30:16  24       active programme management, that happened at about that

12:30:20  25       time.  The way that that resequencing happened was


                                            66
12:30:26   1       through the production of a new long-term plan, namely

12:30:29   2       revision 16, which was produced on 12 March.  That was

12:30:34   3       an example of the sort of active programme management

12:30:37   4       that I mentioned earlier.  It's exactly what

12:30:40   5       Mr Utrilla's job was, and it's the sort of thing that

12:30:43   6       happens day in, day out.  As Mr Saulsbury explains, if

12:30:47   7       you take account of the effect of that resequencing

12:30:51   8       shown in long-term programme 16, the critical delay as

12:30:57   9       at 6 June 2008 is reduced from the upper range of

12:31:03  10       11.6 weeks down to only four weeks.

12:31:09  11           So in summary, and this is shown in the

12:31:13  12       paragraph 5.4 of Mr Saulsbury's report, critical delay

12:31:23  13       as at 6 June 2008 was between those figures, between

12:31:31  14       four and 11.6 weeks.  Putting that another way, if you

12:31:40  15       were to deduct the actual critical delay, which was

12:31:43  16       between four and 11.6 weeks, from the float, which you

12:31:48  17       remember was 19 weeks, what you are left with is that,

12:31:52  18       as at 6 June 2008, there was a remaining float of

12:32:01  19       between 7.4 and 15 weeks, which was available to

12:32:05  20       accommodate any future critical delay to the work that

12:32:08  21       still remained to be completed as at 6 June 2008.

12:32:18  22           My Lord, in the remaining section of his reports

12:32:22  23       Mr Saulsbury addresses those works, the ones that

12:32:25  24       remained to be completed after 6 June, and he asks

12:32:28  25       whether they could have been completed in the time which


                                            67
12:32:32   1       remained before 30 April 2009.  There simply isn't time

12:32:40   2       to go through all that today.

12:32:42   3   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Just forgive the interruption, but the

12:32:47   4       references are all in appendix 4, are they?

12:32:51   5   MR McCALL:  My Lord, yes, they will be, yes.

12:33:02   6           So, my Lord, the conclusions that Mr Saulsbury

12:33:04   7       reaches with regard to the follow-on works after 6 June

12:33:07   8       are set out in page 8, {D6.2/1/8} that's internal

12:33:28   9       page 5, paragraphs (c) and (d), which I hope you have

12:33:39  10       there?

12:33:44  11   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Yes.

12:33:45  12   MR McCALL:  (c) is the point I have just made, that's his

12:33:45  13       conclusion about the remaining float being between 7.4

12:33:46  14       and 15 weeks, that's the point I already addressed.

12:33:52  15       Then in (d), we have his conclusions about the follow-on

12:33:55  16       works, and in short he concludes that those follow-on

12:34:02  17       works, bearing in mind the amount of float that

12:34:04  18       remained, would not have delayed the development beyond

12:34:06  19       the long stop date.

12:34:09  20   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Practical completion in this case

12:34:10  21       includes all the internal fittings, does it?

12:34:13  22   MR McCALL:  Yes.

12:34:14  23   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Carpets, everything?

12:34:15  24   MR McCALL:  Yes.  My Lord, what it didn't include were the

12:34:19  25       sort of small snagging items that often emerge when


                                            68
12:34:23   1       everything else is finished, like a bit of repainting

12:34:26   2       needs to be done here or there is a loose bit of

12:34:29   3       skirting board there, but it's that sort of item that is

12:34:32   4       not included.

12:34:36   5           So, my Lord, in reaching those factual conclusions

12:34:42   6       we looked at, Mr Saulsbury has analysed all the

12:34:45   7       pertinent factual issues that Carey raises.  My Lord,

12:34:49   8       this may be, at least in part, a way of answering

12:34:52   9       your Lordship's question to me earlier, which is: how do

12:34:56  10       we go about dealing with these numerous factual

12:34:59  11       allegations?  Well, Mr Justice Eder obviously had that

12:35:02  12       in mind, because he directed, when giving permission to

12:35:07  13       Carey for expert evidence of this nature, them to

12:35:11  14       produce a list of programming questions for the experts

12:35:16  15       in order to limit the scope of enquiry that the experts

12:35:19  16       had to undertake in a relatively short period of time.

12:35:22  17           So these programming questions were directed to the

12:35:26  18       experts, and they cover what I assume are the most

12:35:31  19       serious issues as seen by Carey which, on its case, lead

12:35:35  20       to inability to complete the development by the long

12:35:38  21       stop date.

12:35:39  22           Now, all of those issues, all of those programming

12:35:42  23       questions, have been taken into account by Mr Saulsbury

12:35:45  24       in reaching his conclusions, and throughout his report

12:35:47  25       he refers at the beginning of each section to the issues


                                            69
12:35:51   1       that he is addressing from those list of questions.

12:35:57   2       My Lord, it may help you at a later date for us to

12:36:00   3       marshall these issues perhaps by reference to those

12:36:03   4       programming questions.

12:36:05   5   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Well, as you know, I am grateful to the

12:36:10   6       parties for the agreed guide to the expert evidence

12:36:18   7       which will come at a convenient point when it's

12:36:21   8       prepared, and that's the kind of thing that can be dealt

12:36:25   9       with there.

12:36:26  10   MR McCALL:  Yes.

12:36:28  11           My Lord, there are just two points I would like to

12:36:30  12       add.  The first is this: in this project, as in again

12:36:36  13       most projects, the subcontractors at times said to IDOM

12:36:40  14       that their works had been delayed and at times those

12:36:44  15       subcontractors sought some extra time in which to carry

12:36:47  16       out their work.  You will hear evidence about that,

12:36:51  17       I have no doubt.  Now, where there is evidence of that

12:36:55  18       sort, Mr Saulsbury has taken it into account in his

12:36:59  19       report and he deals with it, but he has not necessarily

12:37:03  20       accepted it at face value.  He is cynical, he knows that

12:37:08  21       subcontractors claim more than they are expecting to

12:37:11  22       get, that's what goes on on construction projects, and

12:37:15  23       so he has carried out his own analysis to calculate how

12:37:19  24       much, if any, extra time was needed to complete

12:37:21  25       particular tasks.


                                            70
12:37:23   1   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  This is what you call the reality check,

12:37:26   2       is it?

12:37:27   3   MR McCALL:  No, my Lord, the reality check is another

12:37:28   4       exercise which I will come on to in a minute.  This is

12:37:29   5       a different sort of reality check.  For example, there

12:37:33   6       are some instances where a subcontractor -- I won't bore

12:37:36   7       you with details -- wrote a letter to IDOM saying "Our

12:37:41   8       works are going to take longer than we originally

12:37:43   9       thought for whatever reason, we need until X".  When

12:37:46  10       that has happened, Mr Saulsbury has not accepted at face

12:37:48  11       value that X is the date.  He has instead analysed what

12:37:51  12       work had to be done and when and how it could be carried

12:37:55  13       out, and reached his own determination about what was

12:37:57  14       realistic.

12:38:00  15           Now, in contrast, Mr Saulsbury's view is that his

12:38:05  16       counterpart, Mr Chamberlain, has had a tendency to treat

12:38:10  17       that sort of issue at face value, and that's one of the

12:38:12  18       issues that you will need to contend with between the

12:38:16  19       experts.

12:38:16  20           The other side of the same coin is that there are

12:38:19  21       examples of Urvasco, in differences that it had with

12:38:24  22       subcontractors, taking what Mr Saulsbury describes as

12:38:27  23       an ambitious position.  So the example I have in mind

12:38:32  24       was an adjudication between Urvasco and Knight Build,

12:38:37  25       who are the concreters, concerning defects to the


                                            71
12:38:41   1       West Core, that's the sort of tower, of the building in

12:38:44   2       which Urvasco says Mr Saulsbury was taking an ambitious

12:38:48   3       position saying that the delays caused by Knight Build

12:38:52   4       were greater than was actually the case.

12:38:54   5           As with the subcontractors' claims for more time,

12:38:58   6       where Urvasco took an ambitious position, according to

12:39:03   7       Mr Saulsbury, he has analysed the position and reached

12:39:07   8       his own conclusions rather than taking at face value

12:39:11   9       what Urvasco said at the time.  So Mr Saulsbury has

12:39:19  10       therefore been consistent in his treatment of

12:39:20  11       subcontractors' claims and the stance at times taken by

12:39:22  12       Urvasco.

12:39:25  13           Now, finally on this part of my submissions, you

12:39:28  14       mentioned the reality check or the sanity check.  That,

12:39:33  15       as labelled by Mr Saulsbury, is a slightly different

12:39:36  16       exercise which he carries out to supplement his main

12:39:39  17       conclusions and to check his main conclusions.  What he

12:39:44  18       did, my Lord, was to imagine himself as at 6 June 2008,

12:39:52  19       a programming expert who turns up on site, and somebody

12:39:55  20       says to him, "We want you to plan ahead, to tell us

12:40:02  21       whether what is still outstanding at this date can

12:40:05  22       sensibly be achieved by the long stop date".  So he is

12:40:09  23       free of the constraints of the long-term programmes, he

12:40:11  24       is free of the constraints of the baseline, he is

12:40:14  25       imagining he is there, asked to do it his way.


                                            72
12:40:19   1           Of course as at 6 June there was a known scope of

12:40:22   2       work which had been finished, and therefore there was

12:40:25   3       a known scope of work that was still outstanding.  So he

12:40:29   4       imagined that he was placed into that position as at

12:40:32   5       6 June, and on that basis he produces what he calls his

12:40:35   6       notional programme as at 6 June, and that shows that

12:40:42   7       completion could have been achieved by at least

12:40:44   8       mid-March 2009.

12:40:49   9           As I said, that's a useful sanity check, in my

12:40:54  10       submission, because it's of a very different nature to

12:40:56  11       the other exercise that Mr Saulsbury carried out.  He

12:41:02  12       was not in his sanity check relying in any sense on the

12:41:06  13       programmes or the baseline programme produced by IDOM.

12:41:08  14       He was doing it separately, his way, without reference

12:41:11  15       to those documents, and therefore it's a useful sanity

12:41:14  16       check, and in my submission a validation of his main

12:41:19  17       conclusions.

12:41:23  18           My Lord, I am going to move on now to the subject of

12:41:27  19       alleged late or non-payment of contractors.  This all

12:41:32  20       falls to be carried in the same context about the issues

12:41:36  21       of delay about which I have already addressed you.

12:41:38  22       These allegations of late or non-payment of contractors

12:41:38  23       are addressed by Carey in appendix 6 to its submissions,

12:41:44  24       and by GHU in appendix 8 to its written submissions.

12:41:59  25           My Lord, in relation to these allegations of late or


                                            73
12:42:05   1       non-payment, Carey relies on two provisions under

12:42:09   2       schedule 3 to the SPA.  If you want to look at those to

12:42:12   3       remind you, in bundle F3, they are at pages 125 and 126.

12:42:18   4       {F3/4/125} {F3/4/126} It relies on paragraph 1.1(a) of

12:42:36   5       schedule 3, which is the paragraph dealing with

12:42:43   6       completion by long stop date, and it relies on

12:42:46   7       paragraph 1.3(c), which is the obligation on GHU to

12:42:53   8       procure that Urvasco promptly informs the surveyors,

12:42:58   9       G&T, on becoming aware of various breaches or claims or

12:43:02  10       demands, and so on.  So it relies on those two

12:43:07  11       provisions.

12:43:08  12           Under the first, paragraph 1.1(a), on GHU's case,

12:43:14  13       Carey's principal problem is that even if it is correct,

12:43:18  14       for the sake of argument, in relation to its factual

12:43:22  15       case about late payment or alleged failures to pay,

12:43:25  16       there is nevertheless no basis for concluding that that

12:43:30  17       would have meant that the development could and would

12:43:32  18       not be completed by the long stop date.  Carey has not

12:43:37  19       pleaded, nor has it explained, any causal link between

12:43:42  20       the alleged payment failures and an inability to

12:43:47  21       complete the development by the long stop date.

12:43:50  22           My Lord, taking a point which I am sure will be made

12:43:54  23       against me, it is of course true that prior to

12:43:57  24       6 June 2008 there were some occasions where particular

12:44:03  25       contractors suspended work for a period in order to put


                                            74
12:44:08   1       pressure on GHU or Urvasco to pay them.  But, my Lord,

12:44:14   2       to the extent that those instances did or had the

12:44:18   3       propensity to delay the development, then of course they

12:44:22   4       are already fully taken into account in Mr Saulsbury's

12:44:27   5       analysis.  As you have seen he, nevertheless allowing

12:44:32   6       for all of those matters, concludes as he does that the

12:44:35   7       long stop date would have been met.

12:44:42   8           So that's a summary of some of the problems Carey

12:44:45   9       has under paragraph 1.1(a).  In respect of its

12:44:47  10       alternative or different case under 1.3(c), I have

12:44:50  11       already addressed you more than enough about the

12:44:53  12       materiality aspect of that, and in particular in

12:44:58  13       relation to late payment which we are talking about

12:45:00  14       here, it really would have been wholly uncommercial for

12:45:04  15       Urvasco to be required to identify each and every

12:45:08  16       overdue payment no matter how minor.

12:45:12  17           My Lord, this is an aside, but I do it just to show

12:45:17  18       you what is the norm on projects of this sort.  Can

12:45:21  19       I ask you to look in your core bundle at core 3,

12:45:26  20       page 962, it's E45/185. {E45/185}

12:45:32  21           My Lord, I'm not pretending this letter has

12:45:56  22       particular probative value or anything, but it is

12:45:59  23       interesting to show the way things were actually done.

12:46:02  24       I hope you have an email of 4 July from Tony Farmiloe of

12:46:08  25       G&T to Mr Garcia Tapia on behalf of Carey, and it


                                            75
12:46:14   1       encloses the month's report for the London project.

12:46:17   2           At the very end Mr Farmiloe of G&T says this:

12:46:20   3           "Whilst writing, could we ask for confirmation that

12:46:29   4       you intend to pay the four invoices that we have raised

12:46:31   5       to date, as we still await payment from yourselves."

12:46:32   6           My Lord, there is no contractual point that comes of

12:46:33   7       that in this case, but it does illustrate, in my

12:46:34   8       submission, the point I am making, which is that this

12:46:37   9       just goes on all the time in projects of this sort.

12:46:43  10           My Lord, the objective intention, in my submission,

12:46:47  11       as I have submitted, was that paragraph 1.3 of the SPA

12:46:50  12       was only intended to apply to matters which were likely

12:46:54  13       to have a material effect on completion, and I accept

12:46:59  14       that the evidence that you are going to hear over the

12:47:02  15       next couple of weeks will show that GHU frequently

12:47:06  16       stretched the patience of contractors with slow payment.

12:47:10  17       It's not accepted that this constituted breach of any

12:47:16  18       obligation that had to be reported to Carey or to G&T,

12:47:21  19       and it's also certainly not accepted that this would

12:47:24  20       have caused completion to be delayed beyond the long

12:47:27  21       stop date.

12:47:29  22           Now, my Lord, to the extent that Carey wishes to

12:47:32  23       assert that late payment constituted a breach of

12:47:37  24       a building contract or the terms of a professional's

12:47:41  25       appointment, it's for Carey to establish that.  It takes


                                            76
12:47:45   1       the point against me that that's really a very

12:47:48   2       unrealistic position for GHU to take, given that we have

12:47:51   3       the documents.  Well, with respect, that's not right.

12:47:56   4       GHU has given disclosure of every trade contract that

12:48:02   5       exists relating to the pleaded contractors and the other

12:48:06   6       parties named in Carey's voluntary particulars.

12:48:10   7       My Lord, where trade contracts don't exist, GHU has

12:48:13   8       disclosed every letter of intent, every appointment

12:48:16   9       letter, hire order, quotation and so forth, relating

12:48:20  10       those parties.  So as far as they exist, they are in the

12:48:23  11       bundles, in the H bundle.  The disclosure, just for the

12:48:28  12       record, was mostly given on 16 September 2011 and also

12:48:33  13       on 21 December 2011.

12:48:37  14           So therefore Carey is in an equal position to GHU

12:48:40  15       with regards to disclosure on that sort of issue, and

12:48:44  16       it's perfectly fair that it should have to prove its

12:48:47  17       case.

12:48:49  18           My Lord, moving on to a related point which Carey

12:48:54  19       describe as a funding/cashflow hole, they refer to it --

12:49:01  20   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  They have two points: one is funding and

12:49:03  21       one is cashflow?

12:49:05  22   MR McCALL:  Yes.

12:49:05  23           My Lord, this is to do with funding the development

12:49:11  24       on an ongoing basis.  They deal separately with

12:49:17  25       a funding gap at completion, but this is the ongoing


                                            77
12:49:20   1       need to pay contractors that they are talking about.

12:49:24   2       They deal with that in their opening submissions,

12:49:27   3       paragraphs 69 and 70, and it does seem to be part of

12:49:31   4       a theme relating to GHU's alleged inability to complete

12:49:35   5       at the end as well, so the two seem to be related in the

12:49:38   6       way Carey puts its points.  I'll address the latter

12:49:42   7       issues later.

12:49:45   8           My Lord, for present purposes, the key question

12:49:49   9       which I keep coming back to is whether GHU was in

12:49:52  10       default as at 6 June, and in the context of the

12:49:55  11       non-payment of contractors, Carey understandably places

12:49:59  12       much emphasis on a schedule produced by Mr Fernandez of

12:50:02  13       IDOM in June, so it's of the right period, showing that

12:50:09  14       slightly over €8 million euros were due to be paid in

12:50:14  15       June to contractors, and that an additional €4 million

12:50:17  16       was pending over the next three months.  So they place

12:50:21  17       a lot of emphasis on that.

12:50:25  18           My Lord, it is probably worth your seeing that,

12:50:30  19       because it's not in your core bundle, so E38, page 75.

12:50:35  20       {E38/75}

12:50:40  21   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Which one should that go into?

12:50:45  22   MR McCALL:  I'll tell you that, my Lord.  It's also in

12:50:52  23       E38/75.  It should go into core 3, my Lord.

12:51:05  24   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  So what pages do you want?

12:51:08  25   MR McCALL:  Sorry, in the E bundle?


                                            78
12:51:10   1   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Yes.

12:51:10   2   MR McCALL:  It's page 75.

12:51:12   3   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Just page 75?

12:51:14   4   MR McCALL:  No, my Lord, it's probably worth putting in 75

12:51:19   5       to 78 inclusive.

12:51:21   6   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Sure.

12:51:29   7   MR McMULLAN:  It should be in the core bundle at page 829,

12:51:32   8       I think.

12:51:33   9   MR McCALL:  Should it?  I am sorry.

12:51:35  10   MR McMULLAN:  I think so.

12:51:39  11   LORD GRABINER:  Core bundle, page 8.

12:51:40  12   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Thank you very much indeed.  That is very

12:51:40  13       helpful.

12:51:42  14   MR McCALL:  Anyway, you have it now.

12:51:58  15   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Right.  Thank you very much.

12:51:59  16   MR McCALL:  Thank you, my Lord.  There is a column you can

12:52:01  17       see two from the right which says "Certified Not Paid",

12:52:05  18       and it lists all those figures, going on for several

12:52:09  19       pages.  The total on page 77 is €8.389 million, and

12:52:18  20       that's where we get the figure from.

12:52:21  21   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Yes, but forgive me, what am I looking at

12:52:25  22       here?

12:52:26  23   MR McCALL:  Just at the total, my Lord --

12:52:28  24   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  I have that, but what is the document?

12:52:29  25   MR McCALL:  My Lord, this is a schedule produced by


                                            79
12:52:31   1       Mr Fernandez of IDOM in June.

12:52:38   2           It's the document on which Carey understandably rely

12:52:42   3       in advancing its arguments about the cashflow and the

12:52:46   4       inability to fund this development.  The point that

12:52:55   5       Carey make about it is that even if the April tranche

12:52:56   6       had been paid in full in the full sum which had been

12:53:01   7       sought by IDOM, not the sum certified, but the full

12:53:05   8       amount sought which equated to about 4.4 million euros,

12:53:09   9       then there would still, they say, have been a very

12:53:12  10       substantial shortfall against the 8.3 million

12:53:17  11       outstanding shown in the schedule we have just looked

12:53:20  12       at.  That's the point Carey make in paragraph 6 of their

12:53:24  13       appendix 6.

12:53:27  14           Now, my Lord, on GHU's case, it's a bad point, but

12:53:31  15       it's one that seems to be important to Carey's case.

12:53:34  16       It's a bad point because it fails to take into account

12:53:39  17       the fact that the GHU business model involved constant

12:53:44  18       juggling of cashflow, and I'll deal with that in much

12:53:48  19       more detail later when we come to negotiations with

12:53:51  20       creditors.  But liquidity always was an issue, always

12:53:57  21       had been, and it was the job of Julio Esparza Lopez to

12:54:02  22       ensure that cash was available to discharge liabilities

12:54:07  23       when that became necessary.

12:54:08  24           Specifically, I'm not making a general point here,

12:54:11  25       that's just the introduction, I can address the point


                                            80
12:54:15   1       that Carey makes about the position in June about

12:54:19   2       postulated £4 million shortfall when compared to the sum

12:54:27   3       sought for the April tranche.

12:54:29   4           To do that, can I ask you to turn to Mr Lopez's

12:54:33   5       statement, it is bundle C1.1, volume 1, page 167.

12:54:38   6       {C1.1/1/167}

12:54:45   7   LORD GRABINER:  He is Mr Esparza, not Mr Lopez.

12:54:53   8   MR McCALL:  It's internal page 24 at the top of the page, if

12:54:56   9       that helps.  I should remind you, my Lord, that

12:55:11  10       Mr Esparza was and is the head of accounting and the

12:55:15  11       financial department for Grupo Urvasco, and the figures

12:55:17  12       that you see set out on this page were payments that

12:55:22  13       were made from GHU either directly or via third parties

12:55:27  14       to Urvasco and they are supported by the various

12:55:31  15       statements which are in the K bundles.

12:55:36  16           What you can see from subparagraph (g) between the

12:55:40  17       two holepunches is that in June 2008, €4.456 million was

12:55:49  18       transferred from GHU to Urvasco in June.

12:55:54  19           So if you add that sum to the £4.4 million which was

12:55:59  20       sought by Urvasco for the April tranche, you actually

12:56:02  21       get left with a significant surplus of almost

12:56:05  22       €0.5 million after having discharged the 8.3 million

12:56:13  23       obligations which were owed then to contractors,

12:56:16  24       according to that schedule.

12:56:18  25           So what Carey identify, therefore, was not


                                            81
12:56:24   1       a cashflow black hole or whatever they call it; rather,

12:56:29   2       what they identify is what was going on within this

12:56:33   3       group of companies.  It's the normal cashflow management

12:56:37   4       of a company for which liquidity was always an issue,

12:56:41   5       and who employed someone very capable to juggle the cash

12:56:47   6       in order to ensure that cash was available on a needs

12:56:52   7       basis, and that's exactly what happened.

12:56:56   8           My Lord, that would be a convenient moment, if it

12:57:00   9       would be for you, but I could carry on for a few more

12:57:04  10       minutes alternatively.

12:57:07  11   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  No, that's fine.  We will begin again at

12:57:09  12       five to 2.  Give me one moment.  (Pause).  Thank you

12:57:50  13       very much.

12:57:57  14   (1.00 pm)

12:58:00  15                     (The short adjournment)

13:54:38  16   (1.55 pm)

13:56:48  17   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Yes.

13:56:48  18   MR McCALL:  My Lord, I was coming to the conclusion of my

13:56:50  19       submissions about late payment, and my final point on

13:56:53  20       this topic relates to the fact that when the April

13:56:57  21       tranche was not paid on 6 June and no further sums were

13:57:00  22       advanced by Carey after that, the building activity on

13:57:05  23       site, gradually reduced in comparison with what had been

13:57:10  24       planned until the work was finally suspended in

13:57:13  25       September.  That was on GHU's case the immediate and the


                                            82
13:57:17   1       direct effect of Carey not advancing the loan.

13:57:22   2           My Lord, although, as you know, Carey was refusing

13:57:24   3       to make advances at that time, I think as we saw

13:57:27   4       earlier, G&T continued to certify what was due but for

13:57:31   5       the points Carey was taking, and I think I referred you

13:57:33   6       to the table in GHU's opening submissions at

13:57:37   7       paragraph 58, that's internal page 16 of GHU's

13:57:41   8       submissions.

13:57:45   9   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Yes.

13:57:46  10   MR McCALL:  Those are the sums being certified in April for

13:57:49  11       April, May, June and July.

13:57:52  12           My Lord, the point I want to demonstrate for present

13:57:55  13       purposes is that those sums would have been

13:57:57  14       significantly higher had Carey actually been paying,

13:58:00  15       because the work rate on site would not have tailed off

13:58:04  16       in the way that it actually did.  I can do that by way

13:58:07  17       of looking at a projected cashflow for that period on

13:58:10  18       the assumption that payments had continued to be made,

13:58:14  19       and I need to look at the Employer's Agent Report for

13:58:18  20       the April tranche for that.  It's in your core bundle 2,

13:58:22  21       page 640, it's also in L1.1, volume 1, page 179 of the L

13:58:35  22       bundle. {L1.1/1/179}

13:58:43  23   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Page 640?

13:58:46  24   MR McCALL:  620 of core 2.

13:58:48  25   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Yes, thank you.


                                            83
13:58:50   1   MR McCALL:  My Lord, I am looking at a cashflow chart which

13:58:52   2       is unfortunately unpaginated, so it's the bundle

13:58:57   3       pagination is 179, I don't know whether you have that.

13:59:03   4       It doesn't have internal pagination.  It's 627 of the

13:59:09   5       core.

13:59:09   6   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  I have it.  This document is ...

13:59:15   7   MR McCALL:  It's a cashflow chart which was prepared by IDOM

13:59:18   8       on a monthly basis showing the projected forecast

13:59:23   9       expenditure of cash on the job on a monthly basis,

13:59:28  10       comparing it, as time went by, with what was actually

13:59:34  11       sought and what was actually paid.  So, for example, on

13:59:39  12       the document you are looking at, for May the monthly

13:59:43  13       valuation, as you may remember, was £3.7 million.  For

13:59:48  14       the previous month, April, it was 3.3 million, and so

13:59:51  15       on.

13:59:51  16           So what you can see just by looking across from May,

13:59:55  17       June and July is that what was anticipated, what was

13:59:59  18       forecast, but for the funding issue, were valuations for

14:00:04  19       May, June and July of £3.7, £4.1 and £4.5 million for

14:00:09  20       those months.  You can compare and contrast with what

14:00:16  21       actually was paid from the table in 58.

14:00:23  22   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  What was certified.

14:00:25  23   MR McCALL:  What was certified.  Just for your note, it may

14:00:27  24       help you that for May the amount sought by IDOM was

14:00:32  25       1.55 million, what was paid was 1.39 million.  For June


                                            84
14:00:40   1       what was sought was 1.77 million, whereas what was paid

14:00:45   2       was 879,000 and for July what was sought was

14:00:46   3       2.235 million, as against 2.924 which was paid.

14:00:51   4           So those figures, as you see, are considerably lower

14:00:54   5       than the forecast flows.

14:01:01   6           My Lord, I am going to move on, if I may, to the

14:01:05   7       defaults relating to the alleged failure to provide

14:01:08   8       information.

14:01:09   9   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  I am still not sure I understand

14:01:11  10       page 627, the cashflow chart.

14:01:15  11   MR McCALL:  Yes.  My Lord, IDOM prepared this cashflow chart

14:01:26  12       to show the forecast sums that would be sought in

14:01:32  13       monthly valuations throughout the period that the work

14:01:36  14       was expected to take.

14:01:37  15   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  What's the date of it?

14:01:40  16   MR McCALL:  My Lord, this particular one is the date of the

14:01:42  17       report, which is 18 May.  You can see it was updated

14:01:48  18       monthly.  So the forecast figures are in the top half of

14:01:54  19       the chart.  They provide a monthly figure, and then that

14:01:59  20       is added to the previous month to give the accumulative

14:02:02  21       total forecast, which is in the second row.

14:02:05  22           As months go by, the actual figures were filled in

14:02:09  23       below that, so you can see below the heading "Real"

14:02:12  24       halfway down, there is the first row below "Real" which

14:02:18  25       is the monthly valuation that was sought by IDOM, and


                                            85
14:02:21   1       below that the amount actually certified and paid by

14:02:24   2       Losan.

14:02:33   3   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Right.

14:02:34   4   MR McCALL:  I hope that makes sense.  I am using it simply

14:02:41   5       to demonstrate that the forecast cashflows were

14:02:43   6       considerably higher than the sums that were actually

14:02:46   7       sought by IDOM in the months of May, June and July.

14:02:56   8           My Lord, unless you have more questions on that,

14:02:58   9       I was going to move on to failures to provide

14:03:01  10       information.  So this is a topic addressed by Carey in

14:03:17  11       appendix 7 of their submission, and by GHU in

14:03:18  12       appendix 6.  I won't repeat the points about the

14:03:20  13       materiality threshold which apply here.  My Lord, many

14:03:22  14       of the points being advanced by Carey are technical

14:03:25  15       allegations about the content of particular programmes,

14:03:28  16       the exact information provided in particular Employer's

14:03:33  17       Agent Reports, and Mr Saulsbury has dealt with those.

14:03:38  18       I mentioned to you earlier the programming questions

14:03:40  19       that were defined by Carey as required by

14:03:44  20       Mr Justice Eder.

14:03:48  21           My Lord, it might help you, I don't know whether you

14:03:50  22       have seen them, to look at them so you know where they

14:03:54  23       are.  They are in bundle D6.2/2.  This is as an appendix

14:04:03  24       to Mr Saulsbury's report.

14:04:16  25   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  What page?


                                            86
14:04:18   1   MR McCALL:  It's tab 1, page 1, {D6.2/1/1}and this is the

14:04:28   2       list of questions by reference to which Mr Saulsbury has

14:04:31   3       shaped his reports, and so to some extent has

14:04:36   4       Mr Chamberlain, and it may therefore be a convenient

14:04:40   5       starting point when you come to look at a way of

14:04:43   6       determining some of these issues, to use these

14:04:46   7       questions.

14:04:47   8   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Where are you looking, Mr McCall?

14:04:50   9   MR McCALL:  My Lord, for the document itself I'm looking in

14:04:52  10       bundle D6.2, volume 2.

14:04:57  11   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Oh, sorry, volume 2, yes.

14:05:06  12   MR McCALL:  It's tab 1, page 1.

14:05:16  13   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Yes.

14:05:16  14   MR McCALL:  You see that the first lot of questions begin

14:05:18  15       with number 1, unsurprisingly, on page 2.  Number 1 and

14:05:23  16       all the subparagraphs of number 1, which go on for

14:05:26  17       several pages, are all programmes relating to the

14:05:29  18       technical issues about whether or not there was delay

14:05:31  19       and whether that would have delayed progress beyond the

14:05:34  20       long stop date, and they are defined by Carey as the way

14:05:39  21       they would want to pose those questions for the experts

14:05:41  22       to consider, and it's a convenient way, in my

14:05:43  23       submission, of breaking down the issues into something

14:05:46  24       more manageable.  So right through to page 7 inclusive,

14:05:51  25       that is what those questions do.


                                            87
14:05:53   1           Then if you go on to page 8 of the document,

14:05:55   2       {D6.2/2/8} you see a question number 2, and the subparts

14:06:03   3       of that go on for that page and the start of the

14:06:06   4       following page.  {D6.2/2/9} They all relate to the

14:06:09   5       provision of information allegations, and similarly you

14:06:12   6       might find it convenient to use those questions as

14:06:15   7       a basis for framing the matters you have to determine.

14:06:19   8       Apart from that, the point I wanted to make is that

14:06:22   9       because those are questions posed to Mr Saulsbury, he

14:06:25  10       has answered those questions, and as I said, they

14:06:30  11       encapsulate Carey's case, as I understand it, on the

14:06:34  12       failure to provide information and the provision of

14:06:36  13       inaccurate information.

14:06:38  14           Mr Saulsbury answers those questions in section 7 of

14:06:42  15       his first report.  My Lord, it may help to look at his

14:06:47  16       conclusion in bundle 6.2, volume 1.  You can put away

14:06:51  17       volume 2.  It's at paragraph 2.5, page 10 of the bundle,

14:07:12  18       internal page 7.  {D6.2/1/10} He, in conclusion, answers

14:07:25  19       those questions in two ways: (a), he deals with a point

14:07:30  20       which is raised several times about the use of a phrase

14:07:32  21       "accumulated delay zero weeks" which appears in some of

14:07:37  22       the Employer's Agent Reports.  My Lord, his point about

14:07:41  23       that, and it's quite clear, I submit, when you come to

14:07:46  24       look at the documents is that that's a relative phrase.

14:07:47  25       Whether or not there is delay is a relative question,


                                            88
14:07:50   1       framed against the then existing target date, which is

14:07:54   2       changed from time to time as shown in the EARs.  That's

14:07:57   3       the point he makes there.  It's not an absolute question

14:08:00   4       of whether there is delay and therefore what is said is

14:08:03   5       accurate.

14:08:06   6           Then (b), he deals with questions about particular

14:08:09   7       programming information, and he says this:

14:08:13   8           "In my view, no programme is ever perfect or ever

14:08:15   9       able to take account of every possible factor.  Even

14:08:19  10       with that caveat, in the time I have had available to

14:08:19  11       prepare this report, I have not found anything which

14:08:21  12       should have been reflected in the programming

14:08:23  13       information but was not, or which would have made

14:08:25  14       a material difference to what the programme information

14:08:28  15       showed."

14:08:30  16           In my submission, that's actually rather a fair

14:08:33  17       summary to capture what are actually a series of highly

14:08:37  18       technical points that are being taken here by Carey.

14:08:44  19           The main point I wish to emphasise for present

14:08:47  20       purposes is that, whatever retrospective complaints

14:08:51  21       Carey now seeks to make, G&T was fully informed at the

14:08:55  22       time and did, as a matter of fact, make accurate

14:08:59  23       assessments of the then current status of the

14:09:03  24       development.

14:09:04  25           I can best illustrate that by taking you to G&T's


                                            89
14:09:08   1       monitoring report in respect of the April tranche, which

14:09:11   2       is the key tranche.  My Lord, it's in your core

14:09:14   3       bundle 2, page 715; it's also in bundle L1.2, volume 1.

14:09:43   4           So, my Lord, if I could begin at internal page 1,

14:10:02   5       which is 128 of the bundle, {L1.2/1/128} you should have

14:10:09   6       a page which is headed "Introduction", and you will see

14:10:17   7       the penultimate paragraph says:

14:10:18   8           "The report [this report] comments on progress to

14:10:22   9       30 April 2008 and a site meeting and walkabout held on

14:10:25  10       19 May."

14:10:26  11           It makes reference to IDOM's progress report which

14:10:29  12       incorporates the valuation breakdown and so on.  This is

14:10:31  13       the same format used every month, my Lord, typically

14:10:35  14       a site inspection would take place a couple of weeks

14:10:38  15       after the month end and on the basis of that site

14:10:38  16       inspection and the information provided to G&T, G&T

14:10:42  17       would draw up their report.

14:10:44  18           Then on the next page, page 2 internally,

14:10:50  19       paragraph 2.1 under the heading "Programme and

14:10:52  20       Progress":

14:10:54  21           "In terms of the latest short-term programme,

14:10:56  22       discussions and observations on site, IDOM has conceded

14:11:00  23       that a 24 December 2008 target date for completion is

14:11:04  24       not feasible."

14:11:06  25           My Lord, pausing there, you will remember


                                            90
14:11:09   1       I mentioned earlier that there are target dates set at

14:11:14   2       different times and they changed.  What didn't change

14:11:18   3       was the ultimate target date, the long stop date,

14:11:21   4       subject to the legal points that I have made.  But the

14:11:23   5       target date did change from time to time.  So up until

14:11:26   6       this point, IDOM and the Urvasco team had been working

14:11:32   7       to a target date of 24 December 2008 and you can see

14:11:35   8       that they accepted at this point that that was no longer

14:11:37   9       feasible.  Plainly there was delay.

14:11:40  10           We go on, please, to the next page, the top of

14:11:52  11       page 3 is "progress", it deals with the date of visit

14:11:56  12       and the current status, IDOM and Urvasco have verbally

14:12:01  13       conceded they are behind programme.  Anticipated

14:12:01  14       completion date -- well, it was 24 December but it says

14:12:07  15       "This date is to be revised in line with the delays

14:12:08  16       experienced this month", and then the contract

14:12:11  17       completion date is of course the long stop date.

14:12:19  18           My Lord, just below that, "Progress" is the heading,

14:12:22  19       the slow progress on concrete on 9th and 10th causing

14:12:25  20       impact to the rest of the job.  Negatively, since no

14:12:28  21       internal work could start on those floors, et cetera.

14:12:31  22           Well, that's part of the critical superstructure

14:12:33  23       work, as you know, and therefore Mr Saulsbury would

14:12:36  24       agree entirely with that point.  Then below that is

14:12:38  25       a series of bullet points which set out the individual


                                            91
14:12:42   1       items in relation to issues of progress item by item.

14:12:46   2           Then on the next page, please, the top of page 4:

14:12:53   3           "The overall progress on concrete on the ninth and

14:12:55   4       tenth floors in both the hotel and apartment side is not

14:12:57   5       progressing as smoothly as anticipated.  Like the

14:13:00   6       previous month there is only slight improvement with the

14:13:02   7       92 per cent claimed by IDOM last month to the current

14:13:08   8       94 per cent."

14:13:08   9           So you are accurately recording extremely slow

14:13:10  10       progress there, and for good reason, there really was

14:13:13  11       slow progress at that point.

14:13:16  12           Just below that:

14:13:18  13           "The programme for the job has slipped and salient

14:13:21  14       points will be highlighted below based on IDOM short

14:13:22  15       term programming dates for the next month and the latest

14:13:25  16       projected finishing date."

14:13:27  17           So again, this is an example, in my submission, of

14:13:31  18       how G&T were able to assess accurately what progress had

14:13:34  19       or had not been made.  Then three paragraphs from the

14:13:37  20       bottom of that page they recorded this:

14:13:39  21           "The previous one month delays on many items are now

14:13:43  22       snowballing into two month delays.  This is bound to

14:13:48  23       ultimately impact the long stop date of April 2009 if

14:13:52  24       the current trend is not rectified."

14:13:55  25           My Lord, that's a very important observation, in my


                                            92
14:13:58   1       submission.  The figure of two months, which is what G&T

14:14:03   2       identify there, falls squarely within Mr Saulsbury's

14:14:06   3       assessment of delay of between four and 11.6 weeks, and

14:14:12   4       in other words, G&T's understanding of the actual delay

14:14:16   5       at that point, whilst it's not an exact science, it was

14:14:20   6       accurate and it is consistent with what Mr Saulsbury now

14:14:24   7       says.

14:14:26   8           Those examples, my Lord, typify the general

14:14:30   9       position, in my submission.  The actual complaints Carey

14:14:32  10       are making are either plainly wrong or trivial, whereas

14:14:38  11       G&T's accurate appraisal of the status of the

14:14:41  12       development was in no way compromised by the alleged

14:14:44  13       inaccuracies or failures to provide information on which

14:14:46  14       Carey rely.

14:14:52  15           My Lord, I'm not now going to say any more about

14:14:55  16       that, and I am going to move on to material adverse

14:14:57  17       change.

14:15:19  18           My Lord, material adverse change is addressed in

14:15:21  19       appendix 2 of GHU's opening submissions, and in summary

14:15:27  20       what Carey alleges is that, as at 6 June 2008, MACs in

14:15:34  21       the financial conditions in each of GHU, Urvasco and GU

14:15:35  22       had occurred and were continuing.

14:15:38  23           I'll deal with it fairly briefly company by company.

14:15:42  24       First GHU and Urvasco.  Now, as far as those companies

14:15:47  25       are concerned, my Lord, the relevant provision is in the


                                            93
14:15:49   1       loan agreement, it's clause 8(h), bundle F3, page 176.

14:15:56   2       {F3/176}

14:16:12   3           My Lord, that clause requires an assessment to be

14:16:16   4       made of three matters.  First, whether there has been

14:16:19   5       a material adverse change; secondly, it must be in the

14:16:24   6       financial condition of GHU or Urvasco; and, thirdly, it

14:16:30   7       must be a change which takes place between

14:16:33   8       21 December 2007, which is the date of agreement, and

14:16:37   9       6 June 2008, which is the date of default relied upon.

14:16:43  10           My Lord, can I also ask you to note the reference to

14:16:47  11       "consolidated if applicable" in subparagraph (h), which

14:16:57  12       strongly suggests, in my submission, that the analysis

14:16:58  13       is to be undertaken by reference to consolidated

14:16:59  14       accounts where that's applicable.  So in other words,

14:17:00  15       it's a test that has to be focused on an analysis of the

14:17:04  16       financial information contained in accounts and

14:17:07  17       financial statements.

14:17:10  18           Now, my Lord, the last part of the assessment, which

14:17:12  19       is the comparison between the two dates, is very

14:17:15  20       important in light of the approach which was taken by

14:17:19  21       Carey to this topic.  As I have submitted, the court's

14:17:25  22       concerned with identifying changes which took place over

14:17:27  23       that five month period from the end of December 2007 to

14:17:30  24       the beginning of June 2008.  Obviously changes which

14:17:34  25       took place before December 2007 or after June 2008, in


                                            94
14:17:40   1       the second half of the 2008 year will not give rise to

14:17:46   2       a MAC default as at 6 June 2008.  An obvious point.  And

14:17:51   3       similarly, to the extent that the financial condition in

14:17:55   4       the first half of 2008 was similar to or no worse than

14:17:58   5       that in the last half of 2007, well, that is

14:18:01   6       a suggestion that there will not have been a MAC as at

14:18:06   7       6 June 2008.

14:18:09   8           Now, my Lord, you have seen how Carey put its

14:18:13   9       position in relation to this in the June letter.  It

14:18:16  10       relied on completely the wrong comparison.  We don't

14:18:19  11       need to go there again.  GHU's case is that, in order to

14:18:23  12       determine whether a MAC has occurred in relation to GHU,

14:18:28  13       we have to analyse and compare the consolidated

14:18:32  14       financial condition of GHU at the end of December 2007

14:18:36  15       with the consolidated financial condition as at

14:18:39  16       6 June 2008, and that's exactly what Mr MacGregor, who

14:18:43  17       is the BDO expert engaged by GHU on this task, is

14:18:49  18       undertaking that by reference to the position as at

14:18:54  19       30 June, and he has done that by referring to the

14:18:57  20       financial information produced for those dates, for that

14:19:02  21       date, for the IREA reports, which you have probably read

14:19:08  22       about, in October and November 2008.

14:19:11  23           My Lord, the position is summarised, hopeful

14:19:14  24       helpfully, in appendix 2 to GHU's opening submissions,

14:19:20  25       paragraph 43 of appendix 2, page 89 of the bundle, if


                                            95
14:19:25   1       you have it there, internal page 44.

14:19:33   2           It's the second half of the page, so this is GHU, on

14:19:36   3       a consolidated basis, the net current assets of

14:19:39   4       €55.6 million as at 30 June were greater than the net

14:19:44   5       current liabilities of 3.9 million as at

14:19:50   6       31 December 2007.  The total net assets of

14:19:56   7       95 million-odd as at 30 June 2008 were improved over the

14:20:00   8       total net liabilities of €20 million-odd as at the end

14:20:05   9       of December 2007.

14:20:08  10           The further point is made that when the necessary

14:20:13  11       adjustments are made to the net assets, as at

14:20:16  12       31 December 2008 in order to allow comparison with the

14:20:20  13       earlier period, the position as at both 30 June 2008 and

14:20:24  14       31 December 2008 is improved over that at

14:20:28  15       31 December 2007.

14:20:38  16           My Lord, just over the page, it's worth noting that

14:20:42  17       the adjusted net loss for six months to 30 June of

14:20:44  18       €4.2 million compared to the net loss in the 12 months

14:20:48  19       to 31 December 2007 of 25, which also compares well.  So

14:20:54  20       on that basis, there is nothing to suggest that GHU has

14:20:58  21       suffered a MAC in its financial condition as at

14:21:00  22       6 June 2008 by reference to 31 December 2007.

14:21:04  23   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  That's looking at GHU.

14:21:05  24   MR McCALL:  That's GHU, yes.  My Lord, that's of course

14:21:11  25       aggregated information, but it represents the best


                                            96
14:21:14   1       source of financial information which was available as

14:21:18   2       at June 2008.  Carey has not identified any better

14:21:24   3       source of financial information, and it shows

14:21:26   4       an improvement on net current assets, total net assets,

14:21:31   5       and net loss, as at 30 June 2008 as compared with

14:21:36   6       31 December 2007.

14:21:39   7           Now, my Lord, that improvement did result, at least

14:21:42   8       in part, from the sale of the wind farm business which

14:21:45   9       you have probably seen about, the proceeds of which were

14:21:49  10       used to recapitalise GHU.

14:21:53  11           Now, the sale of Urvasco Energia, which was the

14:21:58  12       relevant company, completed on 6 June 2008, which is by

14:22:02  13       coincidence the same date.  The sale price was

14:22:05  14       €363.5 million.  Net proceeds --

14:22:12  15   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Where are you reading from?

14:22:14  16   MR McCALL:  My Lord, these are my submissions.  This

14:22:18  17       information is all in the appendix.

14:22:40  18           My Lord, I'll ask Mr Smith if there is a reference

14:22:43  19       to that in the appendix, which I think there probably

14:22:46  20       will be.

14:22:46  21           If I could carry on.

14:22:49  22   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Certainly.

14:22:49  23   MR McCALL:  The sale completed on 6 June, net proceeds were

14:22:50  24       €135.9 million which were received by GU.  My Lord, it's

14:22:59  25       dealt with in Mr Esparza's statement.  For your note,


                                            97
14:23:04   1       it's Esparza 1, paragraph 57, which is in bundle C1.1,

14:23:16   2       page 162.  {C1.1/162} There is no need to go there now.

14:23:18   3       As Mr Couto says in paragraph 71 of his third statement,

14:23:20   4       it was always intended prior to the sale of

14:23:23   5       Urvasco Energia that the proceeds were intended by GU to

14:23:27   6       be used to recapitalise GHU, and that was formally

14:23:33   7       implemented on 30 June 2008 when GHU issued €150 million

14:23:42   8       worth of new shares to GU, the price for which was

14:23:47   9       offset against a £150 million intercompany loan owing

14:23:53  10       from GHU to GU.

14:23:59  11           Carey dismisses that as a mere book entry, but it

14:24:03  12       wasn't, because its effect was to achieve a substantial

14:24:07  13       increase in GHU's capital and its net assets, and in

14:24:13  14       that sense it marked a real improvement in its financial

14:24:17  15       condition.  Although the capital increase that I've

14:24:21  16       explained was legally implemented at the end of the June

14:24:25  17       month, once the various resolutions and so on had been

14:24:30  18       passed, it's GHU's case that in circumstances where the

14:24:33  19       sale itself was completed on 6 June, and prior to that

14:24:38  20       date it was always intended that the proceeds would be

14:24:40  21       used to recapitalise GHU, then that does fall to be

14:24:46  22       taken into account in assessing the financial condition

14:24:49  23       of GHU as at 6 June 2008.

14:24:57  24           My Lord, if I can move on to Urvasco, the position

14:25:02  25       with Urvasco is dealt with also in appendix 2,


                                            98
14:25:12   1       paragraph 45 and 46.  If I could ask you to look at

14:25:16   2       that, and again the position is fairly helpfully

14:25:20   3       summarised.  So in relation to Urvasco, 1.  The net

14:25:25   4       assets of £38 million as at 6 June were improved over

14:25:29   5       net current assets of 34 million as at 31 December 2007.

14:25:35   6       Total net assets of £30.7 million as at June were

14:25:39   7       improved over total net assets of 20.6 million as at

14:25:43   8       31 December, and therefore Urvasco's financial position

14:25:50   9       as at 6 June was stronger than as at 31 December 2007,

14:25:55  10       and there is no evidence that there had been

14:25:57  11       a deterioration in Urvasco's financial condition as at

14:26:00  12       6 June 2008, that's Mr MacGregor's opinion.

14:26:07  13           My Lord, just to close that off with Mr MacGregor's

14:26:11  14       conclusions on that, can I ask you to go to bundle D3.2,

14:26:14  15       volume 1 at page 31, {D3.2/1/31}  and here in a table

14:26:49  16       I hope you have, Mr MacGregor is setting out the

14:26:53  17       headline figures which he derives from Urvasco's

14:26:57  18       31 May 2008 management accounts, and you can see there

14:27:03  19       the middle column is headed "6 June 2008".  The column

14:27:09  20       to compare with is the "31 December 2007" to the right,

14:27:13  21       and the comparison figures are as I just explained.  So

14:27:17  22       the first total adjusted net current assets is the

14:27:21  23       comparison of £38 million as against 34 in December, and

14:27:27  24       the second total is the total net assets or adjusted net

14:27:31  25       equity shareholders' funds, is as at June 2008,


                                            99
14:27:37   1       30.7 million compared with the 20.6 million figure as at

14:27:42   2       the end of December 2007.

14:27:46   3           Finally, GU.  That's dealt with in appendix 2,

14:27:54   4       paragraph 47 onwards here.  But before I deal with that,

14:28:01   5       can I deal with a point of construction that arises?  So

14:28:06   6       far we have been comparing the end of December 2007 with

14:28:09   7       6 June 2008.  For GU Carey relies on clause 16.10 of the

14:28:17   8       BBVA credit agreement.  We may need to look at that in

14:28:20   9       bundle F4, page 89 of the bundle, {F4/89} and Carey's

14:29:02  10       point is that clause 16.10, which I hope you see on

14:29:05  11       page 89, gives rise to a default through clause 21.4 of

14:29:10  12       the BBVA agreement, which is just a bit further on, and

14:29:14  13       then through clause 10(b)(iv) of the loan agreement,

14:29:17  14       which we saw earlier.

14:29:20  15           So there is an issue of construction, as

14:29:22  16       I mentioned.  Now, my Lord, 16.10, as you will have

14:29:28  17       seen, says that in the case of the guarantor, which is

14:29:31  18       the Grupo Urvasco:

14:29:32  19           "... there has been no material averse change in its

14:29:36  20       financial condition (consolidated if applicable) since

14:29:37  21       the date on which the original financial statements were

14:29:40  22       drawn up."

14:29:42  23           Well, by reference to the definitions within the

14:29:45  24       BBVA credit agreement, that refers to the date of

14:29:49  25       31 December 2003.  However, in the context of the loan


                                           100
14:29:59   1       agreement, which as you remember is dated December 2007,

14:30:02   2       it's submitted that this cross-reference should be read

14:30:05   3       as referring to the position as at December 2007, not

14:30:08   4       2003, as is the case under clause 8(h) of the loan

14:30:13   5       agreement which we looked at before.

14:30:15   6           It would of course, similar to a submission I have

14:30:18   7       made before, be very odd I submit if a different date

14:30:22   8       applied for the purposes of assessing a MAC in the

14:30:24   9       financial condition of GU as opposed to the dates

14:30:26  10       applicable to GHU and Urvasco.  It would also be odd, in

14:30:37  11       my submission, if Carey was able to rely on a MAC which

14:30:38  12       had occurred prior to the date of the loan agreement or

14:30:39  13       the SPA, which in theory would be possible on this

14:30:41  14       construction, not that we concede that there was any.

14:30:44  15       So they would all be odd.  In fact, GU's financial

14:30:49  16       condition was improved as at 6 June 2008 over

14:30:53  17       31 December 2007, and we make a similar comparison to

14:30:58  18       what we did before in paragraph 47 of appendix 2,

14:31:03  19       internal page 46.  I won't run through that, but the

14:31:08  20       same conclusions can be reached.

14:31:11  21           My Lord, in essence, GHU's case is that on the

14:31:14  22       analysis of the available financial information, it

14:31:18  23       cannot be concluded that any MAC had occurred in the

14:31:22  24       financial conditions of any of the companies, GHU,

14:31:25  25       Urvasco or GU, between the end of December 2007 and the


                                           101
14:31:31   1       beginning of June 2008.

14:31:33   2           Now, a serious criticism of Carey's approach is that

14:31:40   3       it eschews analysis of the financial information, and

14:31:46   4       this is in contrast to Mr MacGregor's approach, and

14:31:49   5       instead it's based largely on generalised assertions

14:31:52   6       made in relation to certain contemporaneous documents

14:31:56   7       and what are said on behalf of Carey to be developments

14:32:00   8       in the prevailing economic condition at the time,

14:32:02   9       particularly of the Spanish economy.

14:32:06  10           That's the wrong approach and in our submission does

14:32:08  11       not allow the court to conclude with any safety that

14:32:12  12       a MAC had occurred.  I would deal briefly with a couple

14:32:15  13       of examples of the sort of points upon which Carey

14:32:19  14       relies.  You will have seen firstly it relies on press

14:32:24  15       reports and these were mentioned in the 9 June letter

14:32:27  16       which it saw dated 24 May.

14:32:30  17           My Lord, those are in your core bundle, and they are

14:32:33  18       in bundle E34 as well.  My Lord, in core 2, could you

14:32:44  19       please turn to the first of those reports, which is at

14:32:47  20       page 663.  It's also in bundle E34, at page 98.

14:32:59  21       {E34/98} This is a print-out from something called

14:33:11  22       Deia.com, obviously an online report of some sort, and

14:33:15  23       it's focused on the position of a separate property

14:33:18  24       development company which is a subsidiary of GU, called

14:33:25  25       Vizcaina de Edificaciones in which GU had a 54 per cent


                                           102
14:33:28   1       interest, so it focuses on a completely different

14:33:31   2       company anyway.

14:33:31   3           The next report is at page 670 of core bundle 2, and

14:33:40   4       it's at page 160 of the E bundle. {E34/160}

14:33:49   5           My Lord, this seems to be part of an online blog on

14:33:53   6       something called cybereuskadi.com.  You can see that

14:34:04   7       from the E bundle by looking a few pages back but it's

14:34:04   8       probably not in the core bundle.

14:34:05   9           So it's part of a blog, and I will not invite you to

14:34:13  10       read it all now, but it's not an authoritative source,

14:34:17  11       is what I am submitting for the moment.

14:34:19  12           Finally the third report is on page 672 of your

14:34:23  13       bundle, 164 of the E bundle, {E34/164} and this is

14:34:27  14       a report from something called elcorreo.com, which is

14:34:33  15       apparently a small online -- or at least this part of it

14:34:38  16       is online -- Andalusian newspaper and it says that the

14:34:43  17       Urvasco Group asks the banks for help to avoid its

14:34:44  18       collapse and so on.

14:34:46  19           My Lord, they are not in any sense authoritative

14:34:50  20       sources.  They don't tell the court, in my submission,

14:34:52  21       anything useful about whether a MAC in the financial

14:34:54  22       condition of the relevant companies had occurred by

14:34:58  23       6 June 2008.  More to the point, GHU's witnesses dispute

14:35:04  24       the factual accuracy of what is stated in those press

14:35:07  25       reports.


                                           103
14:35:08   1           So, my Lord, I'll ask you only to go to one

14:35:11   2       reference, which is Mr Couto's statement in bundle C1.1,

14:35:16   3       volume 1, page 83 of the bundle, please.  {C1.1/1/83}

14:35:37   4       You should be looking at paragraph 80(e) of Mr Couto's

14:35:42   5       third statement, and he makes the point four or five

14:35:52   6       lines from the end of subparagraph (e):

14:35:55   7           "... rumours that the Urvasco Group was in

14:35:57   8       restructuring talks with its creditors, that an

14:35:58   9       emergency plan was being put in place, that Vizcaina was

14:36:03  10       negotiating to refinance its debts in order to avoid

14:36:05  11       having to take more drastic measures and that the

14:36:07  12       suppliers were entered into sites to recover materials

14:36:10  13       were not true."

14:36:12  14           Mr Esparza makes similar points in his paragraph 73

14:36:16  15       of his first statement.

14:36:24  16           My Lord, apart from the press reports, Carey draws

14:36:28  17       very heavily on the directors' report in the 2008 GU

14:36:34  18       accounts.  My Lord, those accounts are not in the core

14:36:37  19       bundle, as I understand it, they are in bundle G1.1,

14:36:41  20       volume 3, {G1.1/3/188} so can I ask that those be

14:36:44  21       brought over?  (Pause).

14:36:56  22   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  What page are they?

14:36:59  23   MR McCALL:  It's tab 6, page 188.  (Pause).  So the

14:37:22  24       directors' report is at the top of page 188, and you may

14:37:28  25       just want to read that to yourself, if you have not yet


                                           104
14:37:31   1       done so, my Lord, I don't know.

14:37:34   2   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  What do you want me to read?

14:37:36   3   MR McCALL:  It's the first section headed "Developers", the

14:37:40   4       first two paragraphs of that.

14:37:42   5   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Page?

14:37:43   6   MR McCALL:  Page 188, it's part of the directors' report.

14:37:47   7                             (Pause)

14:38:06   8           My Lord, in my submission --

14:38:08   9   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  This is quoted in the other side's

14:38:12  10       skeleton, I think.

14:38:13  11   LORD GRABINER:  Yes.

14:38:14  12   MR McCALL:  Yes.

14:38:16  13   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  But it may be a good idea to have the

14:38:20  14       document in the core bundle.

14:38:23  15   MR McCALL:  Yes, my Lord.  Would you just like the

14:38:25  16       directors' report in rather than the whole accounts?

14:38:29  17   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Well, certainly at the moment that would

14:38:30  18       be quite a good thing.

14:38:32  19   MR McCALL:  Yes.  My Lord, far from supporting --

14:38:36  20   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Give me just one second.

14:38:38  21   MR McCALL:  Yes, of course.

14:38:39  22                             (Pause)

14:38:43  23   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  What's the date of it again?

14:38:46  24   LORD GRABINER:  March 2009.

14:38:47  25   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Thank you very much.


                                           105
14:38:48   1   MR McCALL:  Yes, it was signed in June 2009, I believe.

14:38:57   2           My Lord, as far from supporting --

14:38:59   3   LORD GRABINER:  My Lord, it's 31 March 2009.

14:39:01   4   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Thank you very much indeed.

14:39:04   5   MR McCALL:  My Lord, far from supporting Carey's position on

14:39:07   6       MAC, in our submission that support is actually

14:39:09   7       consistent with GHU's case.  So the passage you have

14:39:12   8       just read dealing with the development side of the

14:39:15   9       business explains the position in the following way:

14:39:18  10       first of all it explains that there has been a gradual

14:39:21  11       deterioration in the position from the last quarter of

14:39:23  12       2007 so that in spring 2008 the decision was made to

14:39:27  13       sell Urvasco Energia, it's recorded that it was hoped

14:39:33  14       this would be sufficient to resolve any difficulties,

14:39:35  15       but as the report states, the economic situation shows

14:39:38  16       no sign of improvement.  It makes the point that

14:39:42  17       handover of housing had become complicated due to a lack

14:39:45  18       of confidence, numerous buyers pulling out and so on.

14:39:49  19       Then finally it explains that in those circumstances in

14:39:52  20       September 2008 GU commenced the restructuring process.

14:39:59  21       It does not, in my submission, indicate that a MAC had

14:40:02  22       occurred in the financial condition of GU in the period

14:40:05  23       from the end of December 2007 to the beginning of

14:40:08  24       June 2008.  Rather, it just suggests that there was

14:40:14  25       a relatively gradual deterioration in the first part of


                                           106
14:40:17   1       the year, which then became much worse, more or less in

14:40:22   2       line with Lehman, which was in September.

14:40:32   3           My Lord, can I draw your attention to one other

14:40:35   4       point of evidence here?  It's a point taken in

14:40:38   5       Mr Couto's third statement in bundle C1.1, volume 1,

14:40:48   6       paragraph 76.  {C1.1/1/81} This is page 81 of the

14:40:57   7       bundle.  My Lord, paragraph 76, just to put it in

14:41:09   8       context, relates to a deal, if I could put it that way,

14:41:14   9       that was being finalised in about May 2008 where what

14:41:20  10       was being achieved was that a major shareholder in GU,

14:41:26  11       Maria Hernandez, was being bought out of the company,

14:41:30  12       and in order to facilitate that, a new company called

14:41:35  13       Numerus Clausus was created.  Which effectively in the

14:41:40  14       corporate structure of the GU group sat at the very top,

14:41:43  15       it became the 100 per cent owner of the GU shares.  That

14:41:50  16       company Numerus Clausus had to raise money in order to

14:41:55  17       buy Ms Hernandez's shares, and paragraph 76 explains

14:41:57  18       where the money came from to do that.

14:42:03  19           I just want to draw attention to one point, about

14:42:07  20       four lines down, it says:

14:42:08  21           "The third source was a bank loan of €22.5 million

14:42:13  22       provided by a syndicate of Spanish banks led by

14:42:18  23       Caja Vital.  Of these banks, I understand that

14:42:21  24       Caja de Burgos and Caja Duero are also shareholders of

14:42:24  25       Losan and therefore would have been aware of the loan


                                           107
14:42:26   1       being put in place with Numerus Clausus and the reason

14:42:28   2       for it."

14:42:31   3           My Lord, might I add also that BBVA, and you can see

14:42:35   4       evidence of this in due course, was also part of the

14:42:38   5       syndicate that lent the €22.5 million to

14:42:43   6       Numerus Clausus.  The point I want to emphasise here is

14:42:46   7       that in time, in point of time, the end of May or

14:42:50   8       thereabouts of 2008, this is the point at which Carey is

14:42:54   9       now saying that GU and the other companies were

14:42:57  10       experiencing a MAC, and yet its own shareholders at that

14:43:02  11       point, and BBVA, were in effect lending €22.5 million to

14:43:09  12       the group, now in the name of Numerus Clausus.  It

14:43:15  13       doesn't sit comfortably with those submissions.

14:43:34  14           My Lord, still on the subject of MAC, Carey also

14:43:37  15       rely on discussions and communications between GU and

14:43:41  16       its banks.  They say that the very fact of these

14:43:45  17       discussions at the relevant time is evidence of a MAC.

14:43:49  18       My Lord, those discussions or discussions with GU's

14:43:53  19       banks and the banks that were financing GHU as well, as

14:43:57  20       I've submitted before, were very much a feature of GU's

14:44:01  21       business model, and certainly discussions of that sort

14:44:05  22       were not anything new in the first half of 2008.  It was

14:44:11  23       something that always went on with this group.  The

14:44:15  24       nature of the group's business model with huge amounts

14:44:19  25       of bank financing meant that liquidity was constantly


                                           108
14:44:23   1       an issue, and there were therefore constant discussions

14:44:26   2       of that sort.

14:44:27   3           Just to give you the flavour of that, can I ask you

14:44:30   4       to look at a few paragraphs of Mr Esparza's first

14:44:33   5       statement in bundle C1.1, volume 1, if we begin at

14:44:39   6       page 148, please, paragraph 14, {C1.1/1/148} he explains

14:45:00   7       that this is historical as at the end of 2007:

14:45:01   8           "Given the growing nature of the Urvasco Group's

14:45:02   9       business, in particular the high levels of development

14:45:04  10       activity which were being undertaken by the construction

14:45:07  11       companies and the structure of its financing by the

14:45:10  12       banks, liquidity was constantly an issue.  I had a good

14:45:13  13       relationship with all the banks such that if liquidity

14:45:15  14       meant that an Urvasco Group company was not going to be

14:45:18  15       able to make a payment by due date, I would deal with

14:45:21  16       this by speaking to my contact at the relevant bank and

14:45:25  17       he would agree how to deal with the issue.  If liquidity

14:45:26  18       issues were affecting payment to third parties

14:45:29  19       occasionally I obtained short-term finance from one of

14:45:31  20       the banks with which I had a close relationship, for

14:45:33  21       example Banco Vasconia, to fund these payments."

14:45:38  22           Then in the same statement please could you go to

14:45:40  23       page 157, paragraph 42, {C1.1/1/157} Mr Esparza says

14:45:49  24       this:

14:45:49  25           "As I have described above, the Urvasco Group was


                                           109
14:45:52   1       mainly funded by way of bank lending and the nature of

14:45:55   2       its business model was such that liquidity and funding

14:45:58   3       had to be monitored closely.  Conversely, this meant

14:45:59   4       that were continually in discussion with our lenders."

14:46:04   5           Then three lines from the bottom of that paragraph:

14:46:06   6           "The most significant lenders were BBVA, La Caixa,

14:46:11   7       Banco Vasconia, Caja Burgos, Caixa Catalunya

14:46:14   8       [et cetera].  Of these I believe that at least one,

14:46:18   9       Caja de Burgos, is a shareholder in Losan."

14:46:21  10           Then the next paragraph, the same sort of thing:

14:46:25  11           "My discussions with these lenders related to the

14:46:29  12       repayment of existing lending, the rolling over of

14:46:32  13       existing lending, and the terms on which such rollover

14:46:35  14       would take place, and the advancing of new lending."

14:46:39  15           He says:

14:46:40  16           "... these discussions were part of the ongoing

14:46:42  17       management of the Urvasco Group's financing arrangements

14:46:45  18       with the various lenders concerned", and so on.

14:46:53  19           Then taking the matter forward a bit, page 169,

14:46:56  20       {C1.1/1/169} he deals in 74 with the situation as in

14:47:01  21       June when the sale of Urvasco Energia was taking place.

14:47:09  22       He says:

14:47:10  23           "The sale was near to being finalised.  I was in

14:47:13  24       ongoing discussions, as I always was, with the

14:47:13  25       Urvasco Group's lenders about liquidity issues.  These


                                           110
14:47:19   1       discussions were not in any sense about putting in place

14:47:22   2       an 'emergency plan'.  There were certainly no requests

14:47:23   3       at this stage to renegotiate or restructure the

14:47:26   4       Urvasco Group's debt."

14:47:28   5           Then he repeats what he said earlier.  Finally, just

14:47:36   6       taking the slightly different point in time, in his next

14:47:42   7       second statement at page 196 of the same bundle,

14:47:44   8       {C1.1/1/196} he in paragraph 20 makes the same sort of

14:47:58   9       point about the slightly earlier period, January 2008,

14:48:01  10       and goes on to make precisely the same sort of point.

14:48:17  11           My Lord, the communications of that sort which took

14:48:19  12       place with the lenders also, in my submission, have to

14:48:22  13       be seen as part of what they were, which were commercial

14:48:26  14       negotiations.  In other words, they were hard-nosed,

14:48:30  15       possibly from both sides.  The banks wanted the best

14:48:33  16       terms they could get for any new loans; GU on the other

14:48:37  17       hand wanted the best terms it could get, and

14:48:40  18       unsurprisingly that meant that on occasion GU would

14:48:44  19       overemphasise difficulties with its ability to repay in

14:48:47  20       order to persuade banks to accept less stringent terms,

14:48:51  21       and I don't think we need go there, but Mr Esparza

14:48:54  22       explains that in paragraph 21 of his second statement.

14:48:58  23           So for those reasons it would be entirely wrong to

14:49:01  24       suggest, in my submission, that the discussions and

14:49:02  25       communications going on over this period themselves


                                           111
14:49:04   1       represented a change or a MAC leading up to June 2008.

14:49:10   2       They were just a normal and necessary consequence of the

14:49:15   3       group's business model and Carey had been aware of that

14:49:18   4       model when it agreed to advance the loan.

14:49:22   5           Still on the subject of MAC, Carey seeks to advance

14:49:26   6       a case based on expert evidence about the state of the

14:49:30   7       Spanish property market over the relevant period.

14:49:34   8       My Lord, we would point out that there is no permission

14:49:37   9       for expert evidence on that question in this case, and

14:49:41  10       that in any event a general economic analysis of the

14:49:45  11       state of the Spanish property market does not tell one,

14:49:50  12       it doesn't tell you, it doesn't help you to make

14:49:52  13       a decision whether or not there had been a MAC in the

14:49:54  14       financial condition of one of these companies at the

14:49:57  15       relevant dates.  The only way to do that is to analyse

14:50:00  16       the financial position of those particular companies.

14:50:04  17           Notwithstanding that, Mr Beltran, who is Carey's

14:50:10  18       expert on this topic, seeks to analyse downwards trends

14:50:10  19       as he sees it in the Spanish property market, but that

14:50:15  20       gets him nowhere, in our submission.  My Lord, I'm not

14:50:20  21       going to take you to those, but for example he relies on

14:50:24  22       graphs of GDP, household spending, unemployment and the

14:50:28  23       like.  Often, even if one looks at those, and the three

14:50:31  24       I have mentioned are examples, in fact there is a marked

14:50:35  25       downward turn after June 2008, nothing surprising in the


                                           112
14:50:39   1       sort of results he shows prior to June 2008, so it's

14:50:42   2       very difficult to see on any basis what conclusions

14:50:45   3       Mr Beltran can draw from that sort of information.

14:50:51   4           My Lord, I move on to another topic now,

14:51:02   5       negotiations with creditors, and you will recall I think

14:51:03   6       that Carey allege that from January 2008 GU was in

14:51:04   7       negotiations with its creditors, and that this was

14:51:08   8       a default under the BBVA credit agreement and therefore

14:51:11   9       under the loan agreement.  GHU's case is that that is

14:51:17  10       obviously incorrect.  Of course communications took

14:51:19  11       place over that period, as we have just seen, but they

14:51:23  12       were not negotiations with creditors, but in the meaning

14:51:26  13       of the relevant provisions of the BBVA credit agreement.

14:51:30  14       They were instead the sort of ad hoc communications that

14:51:32  15       I have just been talking about.

14:51:36  16           The position did change at the end of September 2008

14:51:40  17       when GU entered into formal negotiations with its banks,

14:51:44  18       and this then led to the IREA restructuring plan which

14:51:49  19       was formulated in November 2008 and was then

14:51:53  20       subsequently implemented.  But that was a change that

14:51:55  21       took place after the comparison date of June 2008.

14:51:59  22           My Lord, to maybe expand on some of those

14:52:03  23       submissions, could I ask you to go to the BBVA credit

14:52:07  24       agreement in bundle F4, page 110.  {F4/110} My Lord, if

14:52:34  25       you have that page, the relevant clause on page 110 is


                                           113
14:52:38   1       21.6(d), and you can see it relates back to clause 21 on

14:52:46   2       the previous page, so the heading is "Events of

14:52:50   3       Default":

14:52:51   4           "Each of the events set out in this clause is an

14:52:52   5       event of default."

14:52:54   6           Then we have 21.6, insolvency, only if the following

14:52:57   7       occurs in respect of a material company.  Of which GU is

14:52:59   8       one.

14:53:02   9           Then we get to item (d).  My Lord, first of all, as

14:53:09  10       a matter of context, the whole of clause 21.6 is dealing

14:53:14  11       with insolvency related defaults, so that, in my

14:53:18  12       submission, gives a strong flavour to the type of event

14:53:21  13       which clause (d) is directed at, in other words events

14:53:26  14       which can be regarded as similar or analogous to

14:53:29  15       an insolvency process of some kind, and also as a matter

14:53:34  16       of context it's necessary to have in mind the serious

14:53:37  17       consequences which arise from an event of default.  You

14:53:44  18       know, obviously, my Lord, the potential for all the debt

14:53:47  19       under the loan agreement to be recalled and for the

14:53:50  20       borrower to be placed into an insolvency process.

14:53:55  21           Just taking clause (d) apart, there are three

14:54:00  22       necessary elements.  My Lord, the first is that the

14:54:04  23       company, GU in this case, must begin negotiations with

14:54:08  24       creditor.  Second, those negotiations must be for the

14:54:11  25       rescheduling of any of the company's indebtedness.


                                           114
14:54:15   1       Third, negotiations must have been begun by reason of

14:54:19   2       actual or anticipated financial difficulties.

14:54:24   3           GU's case is that the clause is therefore directed

14:54:28   4       at a negotiation between a borrower and one or more of

14:54:32   5       its lenders to defer payments of principal or interest

14:54:35   6       falling due in specific intervals under an existing loan

14:54:39   7       for repayment on a new schedule.  It's very precise.

14:54:44   8           My Lord, we summarise the position in our opening

14:54:47   9       submissions, appendix 3, paragraph 5.  That's on page 93

14:54:58  10       of the bundle, internal page 48.  At paragraph 5:

14:55:10  11           "Clause 21.6(d) is triggered by a situation where

14:55:12  12       a borrower who has encountered financial difficulties as

14:55:13  13       a result approaches one or more of its lenders in order

14:55:16  14       to negotiate a restructure of its indebtedness so as to

14:55:20  15       place the borrower on a sound financial footing.  In

14:55:21  16       other words, it involves the commencement by the

14:55:24  17       borrower of a form of restructuring process.  The

14:55:26  18       touchstone is the commencement by the borrower of

14:55:29  19       a process of seeking to reorganise its financing

14:55:32  20       necessitated by financial difficulty."

14:55:36  21           To put this into the context of what had been

14:55:39  22       happening for many months before that, the matters that

14:55:42  23       would not fall within that clause would include

14:55:46  24       an agreement, for example, by a lender to agree to

14:55:50  25       a temporary delay in payment.  Another matter that would


                                           115
14:55:55   1       not fall within this clause would be an agreement as to

14:55:57   2       the terms of new lending, including where this is in

14:56:01   3       replacement of existing lending.

14:56:07   4           Now, my Lord, going to the present case, the facts,

14:56:13   5       on the facts, our position is summarised in paragraph 8

14:56:16   6       of appendix 3, that's page 49 internally.  To take those

14:56:22   7       points shortly, my Lord, you are probably aware that the

14:56:27   8       Urvasco Group was mainly funded by way of lending, and

14:56:31   9       you have heard the points about constant need for

14:56:34  10       monitoring and so forth.  In September 2007 the group

14:56:39  11       had discussions with its lenders regarding the repayment

14:56:43  12       and rollover of existing lending, those were part of the

14:56:46  13       ongoing management of liquidity and did not involve

14:56:51  14       rescheduling or restructuring of the debt.  Mr Esparza

14:56:54  15       deals with that in paragraph 43 of his first statement.

14:56:57  16           Moving on, the communications which took place with

14:56:59  17       the group's bank in the first half of 2008 were also not

14:57:03  18       negotiations for the rescheduling or restructuring of

14:57:05  19       the group's debt.  What those matters involved is

14:57:10  20       explained by Mr Esparza in paragraph 20 of his second

14:57:14  21       statement.

14:57:15  22           In summary, they were the following matters: the

14:57:18  23       repayment of existing lending, including seeking

14:57:20  24       temporary forbearance on amounts owed; two, the rollover

14:57:25  25       of existing lending; and, three, the advancing of new


                                           116
14:57:34   1       lending or the extension of existing lending.  So none

14:57:35   2       of those things which, in my submission earlier, would

14:57:36   3       fall within the clause.

14:57:37   4   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Right.

14:57:39   5   MR McCALL:  My Lord, yes.

14:57:48   6   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Whenever would be a convenient time,

14:57:51   7       Mr McCall.

14:57:52   8   MR McCALL:  My Lord, if I might take about a minute?  Then

14:57:54   9       that would be a good moment.

14:57:56  10   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Certainly.

14:57:56  11   MR McCALL:  Just taking it forward to July 2008, it was then

14:58:00  12       in July that the group's management decided it was

14:58:03  13       appropriate to start investigating the restructuring of

14:58:04  14       the group's debt, so after the relevant date of 6 June,

14:58:07  15       and Mr Esparza makes that point in paragraph 81 of his

14:58:11  16       first statement, and IREA were engaged for that purpose

14:58:16  17       at the end of July 2008.  Again he makes that point in

14:58:22  18       paragraph 82.  It wasn't until the last two weeks of

14:58:25  19       September that GU held initial discussions with its

14:58:29  20       banks about reducing the group's indebtedness, and it

14:58:32  21       was only in December that the group sold the property

14:58:37  22       back to its bank for a consideration of €710 million,

14:58:41  23       which was used to reduce the group's liabilities, and

14:58:44  24       that was the implementation of the process, all after

14:58:47  25       June.


                                           117
14:58:49   1           My Lord, if that's a convenient moment.

14:58:51   2   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  And what was the position, then, you say,

14:58:53   3       in September?

14:58:55   4   MR McCALL:  My Lord, in September GU started its initial

14:59:00   5       discussions with its banks basically about

14:59:03   6       restructuring.  But that was at the end of September.

14:59:11   7   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  I see.  Thank you.  Just a very short

14:59:14   8       break, and I am going to suggest that Lucy moves

14:59:18   9       forward, because there is no reason for her being stuck

14:59:21  10       there in the corner.

14:59:30  11   (3.00 pm)

14:59:33  12                         (A short break)

15:05:41  13   (3.05 pm)

15:08:52  14   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Right.

15:08:53  15   MR McCALL:  My Lord, I am moving on now to the issue of

15:08:55  16       funding --

15:08:56  17   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Yes.

15:08:57  18   MR McCALL:   -- which is addressed in appendix 12 of the

15:09:00  19       opening submissions.

15:09:01  20   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Yes.

15:09:01  21   MR McCALL:  There are two aspects, my Lord, one is the

15:09:04  22       position prior to completion and the funding of the

15:09:07  23       development to that point, the second aspect is the

15:09:10  24       position on completion.

15:09:13  25   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Funding before and funding afterwards?


                                           118
15:09:15   1   MR McCALL:  Yes.  So first I'll deal with the funding prior

15:09:18   2       to completion.  Now, my Lord, GHU's analysis of this

15:09:23   3       period is based on a document which you have probably

15:09:26   4       read about, the April 2008 budget --

15:09:28   5   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Yes.

15:09:29   6   MR McCALL:   -- which will I will take you to in due course.

15:09:33   7       It was produced by Mr Jose Angel Fernandez in

15:09:38   8       January 2010, but it was produced from information which

15:09:44   9       was collated back in April 2008 and deals with the

15:09:47  10       position as at April 2008.  He explains that in

15:09:51  11       paragraph 90 of his first statement, and 57 of his

15:09:54  12       second.

15:09:55  13           Carey, just to put that in context, refers to

15:09:57  14       several budgets, but it refers particularly to a budget

15:10:01  15       which was produced a little later in June 2008, produced

15:10:06  16       by IDOM, and my Lord, also a budget in September 2008.

15:10:15  17           Those figures in those other documents are higher,

15:10:18  18       slightly higher than the April 2008 budget.  What

15:10:22  19       Mr Fernandez explains about that in his paragraph 159 is

15:10:27  20       that the budget that was produced later was produced for

15:10:33  21       the express purpose of obtaining additional funding, new

15:10:37  22       funding, and he therefore deliberately prepared it on

15:10:42  23       a worst case scenario, as he describes it.  So in other

15:10:45  24       words it doesn't reflect what the budget was actually

15:10:48  25       expected to be, it took a worst case approach.


                                           119
15:10:53   1           So for that reason, amongst others, which are

15:10:59   2       explained by Jose Angel Fernandez, GU's case is that

15:11:02   3       subject to certain adjustments which I'll talk about in

15:11:06   4       a minute, the April 2008 budget is the correct starting

15:11:08   5       point.

15:11:10   6           Perhaps as much to the point is this: the April 2008

15:11:15   7       budget has been considered by GHU's quantity surveying

15:11:20   8       expert, Mr Brooker, who says that in his opinion it is

15:11:25   9       reasonable.  So there is a sort of outside expert

15:11:29  10       endorsement for that, although his counterpart, Carey's

15:11:33  11       expert, Mr Boultwood, says that costs would have been

15:11:36  12       somewhat higher.

15:11:37  13           My Lord, the April budget itself is in your core

15:11:42  14       bundle 2 at page 561.  It's also in E31.  My Lord, it's

15:12:02  15       page 561 of your core bundle and page 141 of the E

15:12:07  16       bundle. {E31/141}

15:12:14  17           Really the figure I need to draw to your attention

15:12:16  18       for present purposes is about two and a half inches from

15:12:23  19       the bottom of the page when you are looking at it in

15:12:26  20       landscape.  So there is a column, a row rather, headed

15:12:30  21       "Outstanding Investment", and if you follow that along

15:12:34  22       to the right, the second figure there is in euros,

15:12:38  23       €86.259 million.

15:12:46  24   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Just a moment.  Sorry, page 141?

15:12:51  25   MR McCALL:  So 141, which I hope is headed "Budget


                                           120
15:12:54   1       April 2008".

15:12:56   2   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Yes.

15:12:57   3   MR McCALL:  If you look on the left of the budget, about two

15:13:07   4       inches from the bottom, there is a row with the heading

15:13:08   5       "Outstanding Investment".

15:13:09   6   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Yes.

15:13:09   7   MR McCALL:  Follow that over to the right and the second

15:13:10   8       figure there is the euro figure of 86.259 million,

15:13:14   9       that's the outstanding investment, it represents the

15:13:16  10       difference between the total budget and the investment

15:13:19  11       to date, which is based on the sums certified by IDOM.

15:13:27  12           That's our starting point, the 86.259 figure.  To

15:13:32  13       that, certain other costs have to be added.

15:13:36  14   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Did you set this out in your submissions

15:13:38  15       somewhere?

15:13:39  16   MR McCALL:  Yes, I think it's probably convenient to refer

15:13:42  17       to that, appendix 12, paragraph 9, that's page 192

15:13:53  18       internally.  The various corrections are set out there.

15:14:05  19   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  I don't know how long you were proposing

15:14:07  20       to spend on this, but it might be an idea to explain

15:14:12  21       it --

15:14:14  22   MR McCALL:  Yes.

15:14:16  23   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:   -- so that I have understood it.

15:14:19  24   MR McCALL:  My Lord, the starting point is set out in

15:14:21  25       paragraph 9 as the €86 million figure which you see in


                                           121
15:14:24   1       the second line of paragraph 9.  Then we make three

15:14:28   2       adjustments.  The first is to add a figure of €774,000.

15:14:33   3       My Lord, it says that's referred to in footnote 1 below.

15:14:37   4       That actually is a reference to footnote 202 on the

15:14:40   5       previous page.  You can see the explanation given there.

15:14:52   6       The problem is that the April budget contains no euro

15:14:57   7       equivalent of the sterling contract cost on the budget

15:15:01   8       spreadsheet.  So Mr Brooker has made allowance for that.

15:15:04   9       He has made a conversion, and included the difference on

15:15:07  10       the conversion, as an additional €774,000.  So that

15:15:12  11       explains the first figure.

15:15:14  12           The second adjustment is one that comes from

15:15:17  13       Mr MacGregor's input, and that 9.2 is an adjustment in

15:15:23  14       exchange rate movements which results in a deduction of

15:15:26  15       €3.4 million, and then certain additional costs, and

15:15:30  16       those are, if you would like to see them, set out in

15:15:34  17       Mr MacGregor's report in D4.4, which are added.

15:15:40  18           My Lord, you may not need to --

15:15:44  19   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  They are set out in the footnote.

15:15:45  20   MR McCALL:  -- because they are set out in the footnote.

15:15:47  21       The overall effect of that is to produce the budget of

15:15:50  22       €92.826 million.

15:15:56  23   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  That remained to be funded?

15:15:59  24   MR McCALL:  Yes -- no, my Lord, sorry, that is the budget

15:16:04  25       for completing the works.  I'll go on to say what needed


                                           122
15:16:07   1       to be funded.

15:16:09   2   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Very well.

15:16:09   3   MR McCALL:  The initial sources of the funding, as you

15:16:12   4       recall, were the monies which were available from Carey

15:16:16   5       under the loan agreement and the monies available from

15:16:20   6       BBVA under the BBVA credit agreement, and the amounts

15:16:24   7       that were available are set out in paragraph 11 of

15:16:28   8       appendix 12 on page 193 internally.  So, my Lord, we can

15:16:33   9       go through those.

15:16:39  10           So 11.1, the funds from Carey were to be the

15:16:45  11       equivalent, the euro equivalent of £40 million, and

15:16:49  12       there was a fixed exchange rate set out there.  11.2,

15:16:55  13       the remaining amounts for drawdowns shown as at the

15:17:01  14       April 2008 budget were £64 million, but that figure

15:17:04  15       requires adjusting in the two ways set out below that.

15:17:09  16       So you have to take out the final payment of 35 million

15:17:12  17       which was due under the SPA on completion, and then you

15:17:15  18       have to take out the total amount available from Carey

15:17:19  19       as the purchase price under the SPA, it was 105 million,

15:17:22  20       not 100 million as stated in the budget.  So

15:17:25  21       an adjustment for that 5 million difference has to be

15:17:28  22       made.

15:17:29  23           Then over the page, applying those adjustments, the

15:17:32  24       total available under the loan agreement was £34 million

15:17:36  25       or, if you convert it to euros, it's €47.89 million.


                                           123
15:17:43   1       That's under the loan agreement.

15:17:45   2           Then under the BBVA agreement, you will remember the

15:17:50   3       amount to be made available was the euro equivalent of

15:17:53   4       £44 million, and as at 23 June 2008 BBVA certified the

15:18:00   5       available amount as being €25 million still available.

15:18:04   6       That figure is in the bundle, but I don't think we need

15:18:07   7       to go there now.

15:18:11   8           So when you add up those and compare them with the

15:18:13   9       adjusted budget figure, the result is a shortfall of

15:18:16  10       about €19 million, which is the difference between the

15:18:22  11       budgeted costs to complete as adjusted and the funding

15:18:26  12       under the loan agreement and the BBVA credit agreement.

15:18:30  13           Carey also points out that as at 30 April there were

15:18:34  14       certain costs which had been certified but not yet paid,

15:18:39  15       and although they are allowed for in the budget, they

15:18:41  16       have to be added because they were sums due to be paid,

15:18:46  17       and those amounted inclusive of VAT to €12 million, or

15:18:52  18       if you take out the VAT about 10.2 million.

15:18:57  19           We accept that that figure would have to be funded,

15:19:01  20       so in round terms if you add the 10.2 million excluding

15:19:05  21       VAT to the shortfall of about 19 million, that takes you

15:19:08  22       to a shortfall of about €29 million.

15:19:21  23           The evidence deals with the routes for meeting that

15:19:25  24       shortfall, and there are essentially three, this is the

15:19:29  25       period up to completion.  The first was deferring


                                           124
15:19:31   1       payments to contractors in the latter stages of the

15:19:34   2       works.  Second was funding from BBVA.  Third was funding

15:19:39   3       from GU or its shareholders or the shareholders in

15:19:42   4       Urvasco Energia.

15:19:46   5           First with regard to BBVA, both Mr Couto and

15:19:50   6       Mr Iraculis refer to a meeting with BBVA at which Carey

15:19:57   7       was also represented by Mr Losada, which took place on

15:20:01   8       24 September 2008, at which BBVA said it would provide

15:20:06   9       a bridge pending receipt of further monies from Carey

15:20:11  10       under the SPA.  My Lord, it's probably worth looking at

15:20:15  11       those references because it's quite important.  For

15:20:17  12       Mr Couto it's bundle C1.1, volume 1, paragraph 120, at

15:20:46  13       the bottom of page 93.  {C1.1/1/93} This is dealing with

15:21:05  14       the meeting that took place on 24 September:

15:21:09  15           "In response Mr Garcia of BBVA said that if Losan

15:21:14  16       paid the outstanding subsequent tranches and then paid

15:21:15  17       the remaining subsequent tranches going forward it would

15:21:19  18       be possible to finish the project.  Cesar Losada's reply

15:21:22  19       was that if Losan paid the subsequent tranches to GHU,

15:21:26  20       the project could still not be finished because of the

15:21:30  21       gap between the total amount of the loan tranches and

15:21:32  22       the budget to complete the project.  Mr Garcia said that

15:21:34  23       Losan should not worry about investing their money in

15:21:36  24       the project as BBVA would help Urvasco to finish it if

15:21:40  25       necessary.  BBVA would fund the gap between the


                                           125
15:21:42   1       £70 million to be paid by Losan under the loan agreement

15:21:47   2       and the final sum to be paid by Losan on completion of

15:21:50   3       the SPA."

15:21:51   4           He goes on to say he had other options as well.

15:21:54   5           My Lord, I won't take you to it, but Mr Iraculis,

15:21:57   6       who was also at that meeting, gives evidence to similar

15:22:01   7       effect in paragraph 65 of his second statement.

15:22:04   8           Now, my Lord, that BBVA.  Now, so far as other

15:22:08   9       sources of funding from GU, its shareholders and the

15:22:12  10       shareholders of Urvasco Energia is concerned, that

15:22:19  11       position is helpfully summarised by Mr Couto in his

15:22:22  12       sixth statement.  If I could just show you the relevant

15:22:27  13       paragraphs.

15:22:28  14   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  This is the one of the other day?

15:22:31  15   MR McCALL:  This is one of the ones which were put in the

15:22:31  16       other day.

15:22:32  17   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Where is it?

15:22:34  18   MR McCALL:  Same bundle, the relevant part begins at

15:22:36  19       page 107.3.  First of all, paragraphs 17 and 18, which

15:22:51  20       I'll leave you to read yourself if you wish.

15:23:01  21   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Sorry, which page was it again?

15:23:02  22   MR McCALL:  This is page 107.9, paragraphs 17 and 18 there.

15:23:08  23       {C1.1/1/107.9}

15:23:17  24                             (Pause)

15:23:29  25   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  This one hasn't gone in, I am afraid.


                                           126
15:23:32   1   MR McCALL:  My Lord, I am sorry about that.

15:23:34   2   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Don't worry, just in a couple of

15:23:38   3       sentences for the transcript summarise it.

15:23:40   4   MR McCALL:  Yes.  At 17 and 18 Mr Couto refers back to his

15:23:43   5       fifth statement and he says his objective would have

15:23:45   6       been to keep the funding shortfall to a minimum by

15:23:47   7       cutting costs, but that whatever the shortfall was, any

15:23:50   8       shortfall on funding these costs would have been met by

15:23:54   9       further lending from BBVA and/or by deferring payments

15:23:57  10       to the contractors.  Then in paragraph 18 he talks about

15:24:01  11       Carey's quantity surveying evidence suggesting that

15:24:04  12       costs might have been higher, to the tune of about

15:24:07  13       £50 million, he says he doesn't agree but says:

15:24:11  14           "Even if this is right, had it become necessary, the

15:24:14  15       funds to meet such shortfall could have been raised from

15:24:17  16       sources I have identified in my third witness statement,

15:24:20  17       which I identify in paragraph 21 below."

15:24:23  18           Then in paragraph 21 he sets out those further

15:24:26  19       sources.  Just to summarise them, they are (a) further

15:24:30  20       funding to be advanced by Urvasco Energia's

15:24:33  21       shareholders, so that's the statement particularly from

15:24:35  22       Mr di-Pietro, who had received €26 million in June 2008

15:24:41  23       from the sale of Urvasco Energia.  He says he would have

15:24:45  24       advanced funding amounting to €15 million.  And in

15:24:51  25       addition Julio Esparza would have advanced a further


                                           127
15:24:55   1       2 million.  So that's the shareholders.

15:24:58   2           Then he deals with further funding advanced by GHU

15:25:00   3       or GU and he makes the point first that GU's

15:25:04   4       consolidated accounts for 31 December 2008 show that it

15:25:08   5       had cash as an asset of €96 million.  Now, he says he:

15:25:15   6           "... appreciates that this cash formed part of GU's

15:25:18   7       current assets, which in theory were to be used against

15:25:22   8       the corresponding amount of current liabilities, but we

15:25:24   9       could and would have negotiated with GU's short-term

15:25:27  10       creditors in order to convert some of these current

15:25:31  11       liabilities into long term debt.  In any event the

15:25:33  12       aggregated balance sheet shows that by 31 March 2009

15:25:37  13       GU's current assets were more than €200 million greater

15:25:41  14       than its current liabilities.  Therefore, if required,

15:25:44  15       GU's cash could have been used towards the London

15:25:47  16       development."

15:25:50  17           Secondly he refers to an art collection owned by GU

15:25:54  18       which was valued in January 2009 at approximately

15:25:57  19       €33.5 million, and another insurance valuation for

15:26:03  20       a similar sum, €32.7 million.  He refers to the fact

15:26:09  21       that in GU's 2008 consolidated accounts that collection

15:26:21  22       is recorded as having a value which is less than that of

15:26:22  23       €13.3 million, but he explains that under Spanish

15:26:24  24       accounting rules, those pieces have to be recorded at

15:26:27  25       cost, unless their open market valuation is lower than


                                           128
15:26:30   1       cost, and that explains the difference he says.

15:26:34   2           Then in (iii) he explains that the group owned

15:26:36   3       a number of property assets, and he refers to a schedule

15:26:40   4       of those:

15:26:42   5           "As can be seen from the schedule, the net value of

15:26:44   6       these assets was in excess of €30 million, therefore

15:26:46   7       I could have obtained further funding by pledging or

15:26:49   8       selling those assets."

15:26:52   9           In (iv) he refers to €17.5 million worth of sale

15:27:00  10       proceeds of Urvasco Energia which was paid into

15:27:02  11       an escrow account to cover potential future

15:27:08  12       contingencies. Those contingencies up to July 2012 had

15:27:12  13       amounted to just over €1 million, and to date

15:27:16  14       €14.6 million has been released to GU, there was

15:27:21  15       a further €1.77 million plus interest which is due in

15:27:27  16       July 2013, and therefore he considers that that could

15:27:30  17       have been used to secure funding of between €10 million

15:27:34  18       and €12 million.

15:27:38  19           Finally he refers to an extract from GHU's

15:27:40  20       intercompany account with Urvasco between 31 May 2008

15:27:43  21       and 31 December 2009, and without taking into account

15:27:48  22       certain capitalisation of approximately €19 million of

15:27:50  23       the intercompany loan for the purpose of the whitewash

15:27:54  24       procedure in July 2008, it can be seen that in the

15:27:58  25       period from June 2008 to April 2009, the net cash


                                           129
15:28:00   1       transfers from GHU to Urvasco amounting to approximately

15:28:04   2       €3.37 million.

15:28:06   3           "In the period June 2008 to 31 December 2009 the

15:28:16   4       cash transfers were 5.59 million.  If Carey had

15:28:18   5       fulfilled its obligations under the loan agreement these

15:28:22   6       finds could have been used for the purposes of

15:28:22   7       completing London development."

15:28:25   8           So in short, on GHU's case, he describes sources of

15:28:31   9       funding which very significantly more than cover the

15:28:35  10       alleged gap.

15:28:36  11   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  You accept that €29 million, as

15:28:40  12       I understand it, that was my note I made about that.

15:28:44  13   MR McCALL:  Yes.  My Lord, dealing with the position as at

15:28:48  14       September 2008, GHU accepts that at the end of

15:28:52  15       September 2008 a default occurred as a result of GU at

15:28:57  16       that stage entering into restructuring negotiations with

15:28:59  17       its lenders.  In Carey's opening it puts its case very

15:29:05  18       high in that respect.  It says that that fact alone

15:29:09  19       deals with and eliminates GHU's claim for damages.  What

15:29:15  20       Carey says is that in order to keep its claim alive, GHU

15:29:19  21       is driven to say that Carey would have continued lending

15:29:23  22       despite having a ground on which to stop lending, and

15:29:27  23       that that position shows the unreality of the damages

15:29:32  24       claim.  So that's the way Carey puts its point, and that

15:29:37  25       case on GHU's submissions is wrong on a number of


                                           130
15:29:43   1       levels.

15:29:46   2           The first point to make is that it is actually not

15:29:50   3       at all unreal to suggest that Carey would have kept

15:29:51   4       lending in the situation that we are imagining.

15:29:54   5   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Again, this is set out somewhere in your

15:29:57   6       submissions, I think.

15:29:57   7   MR McCALL:  It is, my Lord.  My Lord, this is all in

15:30:03   8       appendix 12.

15:30:04   9   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Yes.

15:30:07  10   MR McCALL:  The relevant parts begin on paragraph 30.

15:30:18  11   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Thank you.

15:30:19  12   MR McCALL:  Thank you.

15:30:21  13           So, my Lord, the first thing is to bear in mind that

15:30:24  14       we are concerned here in the scenario that I am

15:30:27  15       addressing you about with what the position would have

15:30:30  16       been but for Carey's breaches in failing to lend from

15:30:34  17       June onwards.  So we have to imagine what the situation

15:30:38  18       would have been, but for that breach.  So on that

15:30:43  19       hypothesis, Carey would have funded the development up

15:30:46  20       to the end of September 2008.  So it therefore would

15:30:49  21       have invested first its initial tranche of £30 million,

15:30:56  22       it would then have invested the February and March

15:30:59  23       tranches which it paid, which totalled about

15:31:01  24       5.5 million.  It then would have paid tranches for

15:31:07  25       April, May, June, July and potentially August.  I've


                                           131
15:31:11   1       taken the G&T figures for those with the exception of

15:31:14   2       August, which was an IDOM EAR, and if you add those up

15:31:19   3       they come to £8.9 million.

15:31:22   4           So if you add those up, by September Carey would

15:31:26   5       already have invested about £44 million, and in fact on

15:31:32   6       the basis that I submitted earlier, that investment

15:31:34   7       would have been higher, and I am referring back to the

15:31:37   8       point about cashflow projections, which would have been

15:31:41   9       higher -- or rather the actual expenditure would have

15:31:43  10       been higher but for the fact that activity on site wound

15:31:47  11       down, precisely because Carey was not paying the

15:31:52  12       tranches of the loan after June.

15:31:54  13           So the actual expenditure is rather hard to quantify

15:31:57  14       in that situation, but certainly the investment would

15:32:00  15       have been more than the 44 million I mentioned, and the

15:32:05  16       extent to which contractor resources were diminished is

15:32:09  17       addressed by Mr Jose Angel Fernandez in his

15:32:13  18       paragraphs 131 and 150 and 152.

15:32:22  19           So with all those factors in mind, it's not

15:32:25  20       unreasonable, in my submission, to assume that by

15:32:27  21       September 2008 Carey would have invested round about

15:32:31  22       £50 million in the development and perhaps even more.

15:32:40  23           Now, again, on this hypothesis, we have to remember

15:32:41  24       that on GHU's case, as at September, completion of the

15:32:42  25       development would only have been seven months away.  In


                                           132
15:32:45   1       those circumstances, in my submission it's certainly not

15:32:49   2       unreasonable to question whether Carey would actually

15:32:52   3       have refused to fund further in circumstances where

15:32:56   4       a negotiation default had arisen, that's all it was,

15:33:00   5       a negotiation default, because GU was negotiating with

15:33:03   6       its lenders over a restructuring plan.

15:33:08   7           The negotiation default in itself would not have

15:33:12   8       threatened the development.  Carey, as I've submitted,

15:33:16   9       would have been a long way down the road to completion,

15:33:20  10       both in money and in time terms, and the end would very

15:33:24  11       much be in sight.  So it's in that hypothetical scenario

15:33:29  12       that GHU's case is that Carey would in fact have funded

15:33:34  13       or continued to fund as at September, notwithstanding

15:33:38  14       the negotiation default.

15:33:40  15           My Lord, that aside, even if Carey had not funded

15:33:44  16       from the end of September onwards, the development would

15:33:47  17       still have been completed.  Now, the effect of Carey not

15:33:53  18       advancing the loan would be to increase the amount which

15:33:56  19       had to be funded on completion by Carey, so it would

15:34:00  20       have increased the amount payable under the SPA up to

15:34:03  21       the 105 million purchase price, less the loan that had

15:34:07  22       already been paid.  So it would have been swings and

15:34:12  23       roundabouts to that extent.

15:34:13  24           I should make it clear that it is not part of

15:34:16  25       Carey's pleaded case that it would have refused to


                                           133
15:34:19   1       complete under the SPA.  Its only case, at least as

15:34:22   2       pleaded, is limited to the loan agreement.

15:34:27   3           So for that reason any gap would have been of

15:34:29   4       a temporary nature which it would have been necessary to

15:34:33   5       bridge until completion under the SPA.  Carey has not

15:34:42   6       quantified what it says that sum would be, although it

15:34:47   7       has been put to proof of that in the reply, and Carey

15:34:51   8       has not responded to that.  The reply,

15:34:55   9       paragraph 61.12(c) puts Carey to proof in that regard.

15:35:03  10           My Lord, the gap I am talking about, which is

15:35:05  11       a bridging gap, would have been bridged by one or more

15:35:08  12       of the methods that I have identified, particularly of

15:35:11  13       course the possibility of lending from BBVA.  I have

15:35:16  14       already been through the various other alternatives that

15:35:20  15       were available at that period.

15:35:22  16           My Lord, I move on -- I was dealing there entirely

15:35:26  17       with the position before completion -- now to the

15:35:29  18       position on completion, and we address that in

15:35:32  19       appendix 12 again, paragraphs 19 to 32.  My Lord, to

15:35:51  20       summarise the position, we need to look at the income

15:35:54  21       available to GHU on completion and then compare that

15:35:57  22       with the liabilities which would have been required to

15:35:59  23       be discharged.  The income side is dealt with in

15:36:02  24       paragraph 21.  Two points: the monies available under

15:36:06  25       the lease with LPS would have been received, so that's


                                           134
15:36:09   1       a further £64 million.

15:36:12   2   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Sorry, which paragraph?

15:36:13   3   MR McCALL:  This is 21.1.  You remember I addressed you

15:36:17   4       about the lease at the beginning of the day, and on

15:36:19   5       completion -- this is the lease of the apartments.

15:36:22   6   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  What page is it, I am sorry?

15:36:25   7   MR McCALL:  It's page 196 internally.

15:36:27   8   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  I am sorry.  Yes.

15:36:38   9   MR McCALL:  So this is income to be received on completion,

15:36:41  10       an outstanding £64 million under the lease from LPS.

15:36:47  11       Then paragraph 21.2, the outstanding part of the

15:36:52  12       purchase price from Carey under the SPA, which was

15:36:54  13       £35 million or €48.5 million.

15:37:01  14           That's the income side.  The liability side is dealt

15:37:05  15       with in paragraph 22.  So the first point is the

15:37:10  16       repayment of the BBVA loan.  The second point is the

15:37:18  17       making good of the gap on funding of construction, in

15:37:22  18       other words repaying any further loan from BBVA or

15:37:26  19       paying any contractors whose payments have been

15:37:29  20       deferred.  As between the income and liabilities that

15:37:35  21       I have just mentioned, there would have been

15:37:37  22       a shortfall -- and this is paragraph 25.3 -- of about

15:37:45  23       €23 million.

15:37:56  24           My Lord, I referred earlier to the £12 million in

15:37:59  25       respect of costs incurred but not paid as at 30 April.


                                           135
15:38:04   1       Well, if that hadn't been discharged earlier, that would

15:38:07   2       be added at this stage; one or the other.  Even if

15:38:10   3       I assume that that had to be added at this stage rather

15:38:12   4       than the earlier, my Lord, one adds those two figures

15:38:18   5       together, the 23 million, the 10.2 million, which is the

15:38:21   6       costs unpaid as at April, it would also have been

15:38:25   7       necessary to put in place a bank bond for the first

15:38:28   8       18 months of rent payments under the lease.  That's

15:38:31   9       addressed in paragraph 37 of appendix 12.  That would

15:38:40  10       have been to the tune of £10 million.

15:38:44  11           So if I add up those figures at the prevailing

15:38:49  12       exchange rates, the total is about €45 million.

15:38:57  13       My Lord, the shortfall there would have been met in the

15:39:01  14       manner that Mr Couto addressed, as I read to you

15:39:06  15       earlier, from paragraph 21(b) of his statement.  In

15:39:10  16       other words, funding from GHU or GU and funding from the

15:39:13  17       Urvasco Energia shareholders.  In particular, in

15:39:19  18       relation to the position of the group, GU and GHU,

15:39:24  19       I remind you of the cash on the balance sheet of

15:39:27  20       €96 million, I remind you of the 30 million valued art

15:39:39  21       collection, €30 million, the unencumbered property

15:39:40  22       assets, and the €7.5 million of proceeds from

15:39:44  23       Urvasco Energia held in escrow -- 17.5 million.  I think

15:39:51  24       I might have used some other figure.  17.5.

15:39:55  25           That's money that would have come from GU, as it


                                           136
15:39:57   1       were, or lending based on GU's assets.  There is then of

15:40:04   2       course the Urvasco Energia shareholders, so Mr di-Pietro

15:40:08   3       who says he would have invested a further €15 million,

15:40:11   4       and Julio Esparza, who would have invested 2 million.

15:40:23   5           So, my Lord, that's our position on funding.  It's

15:40:30   6       necessarily a case which is hard to structure because

15:40:35   7       the figures are, in many ways, hypothetical.  But the

15:40:42   8       various sources that I have identified and that Mr Couto

15:40:44   9       has identified would, in my submission, more than amply

15:40:47  10       have covered the funding gap on any of the assumptions

15:40:52  11       that we have been asked to make.

15:41:01  12           My Lord, I am going to move on to another topic

15:41:04  13       which I can take very briefly, BBVA defaults.  My Lord,

15:41:11  14       Carey alleges that further defaults under the loan

15:41:13  15       agreement occurred which it says arose from defaults

15:41:16  16       under the BBVA credit agreement, and those are dealt

15:41:20  17       with by GHU in appendix 8 of its opening submissions,

15:41:25  18       paragraph 13 onwards.

15:41:35  19           My Lord, I just want to say a little about the way

15:41:37  20       these defaults as alleged by Carey are structured.  Some

15:41:40  21       of the defaults relate to the period before

15:41:43  22       21 December 2007, some to the period afterwards.

15:41:47  23       My Lord, insofar as Carey relies on defaults prior to

15:41:51  24       December 2007 it relies on clause 4.1 of the

15:41:56  25       intercreditor agreement.  Can I invite you to look at


                                           137
15:41:59   1       that, please, in F4, page 146, and the relevant clause

15:42:24   2       is 4.1 where it says: {F4/146}

15:42:27   3           "Each obligor represents and warrants to each of the

15:42:30   4       secured parties that, as of the date of this letter

15:42:33   5       [which is 21 December 2007] no event of default has

15:42:37   6       occurred and under the terms and conditions of the BBVA

15:42:39   7       facility or the Losan agreement."

15:42:46   8           It is said that:

15:42:46   9           "A breach of this representation gives rise to

15:42:48  10       a default under clause 10(b)(ii) of the loan agreement."

15:42:53  11           My Lord, if you would kindly turn to 10(b)(ii) of

15:42:58  12       the loan agreement, it's in bundle F3 at page 181:

15:43:02  13       {F3/181}

15:43:19  14           "An event of default occurs if, (ii)" --

15:43:25  15   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  I am not there.  Where is it?

15:43:27  16   MR McCALL:  I am looking at clause 10 of the loan agreement,

15:43:27  17       page 181 of bundle F3. {F3/181}

15:43:41  18   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Yes.

15:43:43  19   MR McCALL:  (b) says:

15:43:44  20           "An event of default occurs if:

15:43:47  21           "(ii) the seller [that's GHU] breaches or fails to

15:43:49  22       observe any other conditions of this loan agreement or

15:43:52  23       [and this is the relevant part] any other document to

15:43:55  24       which the seller or nominee are both parties and fails

15:43:59  25       to remedy", and so on.


                                           138
15:44:01   1           My Lord, the seller is GHU, the nominee as you know

15:44:04   2       is LVA.  But LVA is not a party to the intercreditor

15:44:11   3       agreement in F4.  So although it may be that the wording

15:44:18   4       in 10(b)(ii) is a little strange, an initial problem

15:44:23   5       with Carey's allegation is that a breach of the

15:44:25   6       intercreditor agreement does not give rise to a default

15:44:28   7       under 10(b)(ii) --

15:44:30   8   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Is this in your opening submissions?

15:44:33   9   MR McCALL:  No, this is a point that isn't in the

15:44:36  10       submissions.  But it's based on the fact that LVA is not

15:44:42  11       a party to the intercreditor agreement.

15:44:45  12           Turning now to post December 2007 defaults, in

15:44:49  13       relation to that, Carey say that these defaults gave

15:44:56  14       rise to a default directly under clause 10(b)(iv) of the

15:44:59  15       loan agreement.

15:45:02  16   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Right, just a moment.  Yes.

15:45:07  17   MR McCALL:  So this is post December 2007 defaults, and

15:45:11  18       Carey is relying in respect of those on 10(b)(iv) of the

15:45:15  19       loan agreement, BBVA default.

15:45:18  20   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Yes.

15:45:18  21   MR McCALL:  In its opening submissions, Carey focuses --

15:45:22  22       wrongly, we submit -- on the question as being one of

15:45:26  23       whether breach occurred under the BBVA credit agreement.

15:45:29  24       That's in Carey's submissions, appendix 9, paragraph 12.

15:45:34  25           That is in support of a submission that, once


                                           139
15:45:39   1       a breach had occurred, say Carey, then it's sufficient

15:45:43   2       to give rise to a default, even if it is subsequently

15:45:47   3       waived by BBVA, and waiver does come into this.

15:45:50   4           That's wrong, we submit.  The starting point is the

15:45:55   5       loan agreement itself, clause 3(c)(i).  This is page 173

15:46:05   6       of the loan agreement.  There the condition is that the

15:46:18   7       default must be continuing or would result from the

15:46:21   8       proposed drawdown.  So Carey has to show in this respect

15:46:25   9       a continuing default.  In short, it's not sufficient

15:46:29  10       that a default has occurred; rather, it must be

15:46:34  11       continuing on the proposed drawdown date and for that

15:46:38  12       reason, Carey's assertion seems to be wrong.

15:46:41  13           My Lord, if a BBVA default had occurred but was then

15:46:45  14       waived by BBVA, it would no longer be a continuing

15:46:49  15       default and could not be relied on as at the proposed

15:46:53  16       drawdown date.

15:46:55  17           With regard to what the alleged defaults are, I am

15:47:04  18       just taking these from paragraph 67 of the defence.  The

15:47:05  19       first is an alleged improper application of loans made

15:47:06  20       under the BBVA credit agreement in November and

15:47:10  21       December 2007.

15:47:11  22           Secondly, it's alleged late payment of interest and

15:47:14  23       other sums during 2007.

15:47:19  24           Third, it's the failure to maintain sufficient funds

15:47:23  25       in the debt service account.


                                           140
15:47:25   1           Finally, the alleged breaches of contract and

15:47:27   2       appointments by failing to make payments to contractors,

15:47:29   3       which we have discussed, but in November and

15:47:31   4       December 2007.

15:47:33   5           My Lord, as far as those first three defaults are

15:47:36   6       concerned, GHU accepts that those technical breaches

15:47:42   7       occurred but, for a number of reasons, they did not give

15:47:48   8       rise to a default under the loan agreement, and that's

15:47:50   9       in addition to the point that I made earlier that

15:47:52  10       a breach of the intercreditor agreement does not fall

15:47:56  11       within clause 10(b)(ii) of the loan agreement because of

15:48:00  12       LVA.

15:48:02  13           My Lord, I won't go over in any length the basis on

15:48:07  14       which these submissions are made, because it's dealt

15:48:11  15       with at length in the appendices, but the position first

15:48:14  16       is based on waiver and estoppel.  The point being that

15:48:18  17       BBVA was well aware of the relevant matters, and those

15:48:21  18       are dealt with in Mr Esparza's second witness statement,

15:48:24  19       paragraphs 11, 12, 14 and 17.  Secondly, BBVA acquiesced

15:48:33  20       in any breaches which occurred, and as such, any of

15:48:36  21       those breaches were waived by BBVA or it, BBVA, would be

15:48:42  22       estopped from relying on them.  Our case on that is

15:48:46  23       again expanded in the appendices.

15:48:51  24           In addition to those points, my Lord, there is the

15:48:55  25       position about materiality which I have made before, the


                                           141
15:48:56   1       loan agreement being governed by Spanish law and

15:49:01   2       therefore we submit that on a proper construction of the

15:49:05   3       loan agreement a BBVA default would not arise under

15:49:09   4       clause 10(b)(iv) of the loan agreement by reason of any

15:49:13   5       breach of the BBVA agreement, no matter how minor or

15:49:17   6       immaterial, it would have to be a material breach for

15:49:19   7       the purpose of section 10(b)(iv).  And such a default

15:49:24   8       would only arise where the BBVA default was likely to

15:49:27   9       have a material effect on the development by affecting

15:49:31  10       the ability to complete the development by the long stop

15:49:35  11       date or by affecting GHU's ability to repay interest or

15:49:39  12       principal under the loan agreement.  None of those are

15:49:43  13       matters which could possibly arise in relation to the

15:49:46  14       technical defaults alleged.

15:49:47  15           Finally, any BBVA default in respect of the matters

15:49:50  16       identified by Carey in respect of the application of

15:49:53  17       proceeds and late payments and so on, and any obligation

15:49:57  18       on the part of GHU to make notifications to Carey did

15:50:03  19       not have such a material effect.

15:50:08  20           So, my Lord, in a short way, that is our case in

15:50:12  21       relation to BBVA defaults.

15:50:17  22           My Lord, just to wrap up a few final points, another

15:50:21  23       series of allegations relate to the alleged improper

15:50:26  24       application of subsequent tranches, and GHU deals with

15:50:29  25       that topic fairly exhaustively in appendix 7 to its


                                           142
15:50:33   1       opening submissions, and we have nothing that we wish to

15:50:36   2       add to what is there in writing.

15:50:43   3           Finally, my Lord, I just want to summarise the

15:50:46   4       position in relation to quantum.  I won't do that at any

15:50:50   5       length at all, because you haven't I am sure read the

15:50:54   6       quantum reports yet and you have reading days for that

15:50:57   7       available later.

15:50:58   8   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  No, but I think if you are going to press

15:51:01   9       the claim, you have to do whatever is required in the

15:51:05  10       opening.

15:51:06  11   MR McCALL:  Yes.  So, my Lord, the claim for damages is

15:51:08  12       dealt with in appendix 11 of the opening submissions,

15:51:12  13       and as you have seen, the claim is based on the premise

15:51:15  14       that but for Carey's breaches of the loan agreement, the

15:51:19  15       development would have proceeded to completion, GHU

15:51:22  16       would have enjoyed the fruits of the operation of the

15:51:25  17       hotel profitably, that engages the question of the

15:51:28  18       funding required to complete the development, and I have

15:51:32  19       already touched on that.  The structure of the damages

15:51:36  20       claim is, first, that Carey was in breach of contract by

15:51:39  21       not lending as of June 2008 or subsequently; two, but

15:51:45  22       for those breaches, the development would have proceeded

15:51:48  23       to completion; and, three, contrary to the assertions

15:51:53  24       now made by Carey, GHU was not able to obtain to

15:51:55  25       replacement funding as at June 2008.  If it would have


                                           143
15:51:59   1       been able to, it would have done so.

15:52:03   2           Now, in practice, obtaining replacement funding as

15:52:07   3       at June or thereabouts, which is one of the themes that

15:52:10   4       Carey draws on in its opening statement, it would not

15:52:14   5       merely have involved finding funding for the April

15:52:17   6       tranche or the June tranche or anything like that;

15:52:19   7       rather, in practice, it would have been necessary to

15:52:21   8       find a new lender to replace Carey.  In other words,

15:52:25   9       a new lender who was willing and able to advance the

15:52:28  10       remaining sums of about £70 million then due from Carey

15:52:34  11       under the loan agreement and the SPA, and to take out

15:52:37  12       Carey's existing advance which was £35 million.

15:52:49  13           That is in effect the exercise that the parties

15:52:49  14       tried to undertake under the auspices of the 21 October

15:52:52  15       agreement, the standstill agreement, and it did not

15:52:55  16       unfortunately result in a new lender being found on that

15:52:58  17       basis.

15:52:58  18           So finding a new lender on that basis, my Lord, is

15:53:02  19       qualitatively different from the question of finding

15:53:07  20       some further funding to bridge a gap, say 30 million or

15:53:12  21       whatever it would have been, at the end of

15:53:13  22       September 2008, which is, as I have submitted,

15:53:17  23       a bridging or temporary facility, very unlike the

15:53:22  24       alternative which would have been involved in effect in

15:53:25  25       replacing Carey wholesale in June or July.


                                           144
15:53:30   1           The claim for damages breaks down into two elements.

15:53:35   2       First, there is the loss of profits claim which is the

15:53:38   3       loss of profits which would have been generated from the

15:53:41   4       operation of the hotel once it had opened, and secondly

15:53:46   5       there is the development loss claim which is the loss

15:53:49   6       which resulted from the early termination of the

15:53:52   7       construction of the development, we would not have

15:53:54   8       happened but for Carey's breaches.

15:53:58   9           Those elements, the loss of profit and the

15:54:00  10       development loss claims, are cumulative and they are

15:54:04  11       therefore added together to get the total loss claimed.

15:54:08  12           In relation to currency, my Lord, the development

15:54:12  13       used, as you have seen, both sterling and euros, and

15:54:16  14       although at one stage Mr MacGregor tried to convert into

15:54:20  15       one currency, it's proved more satisfactory that, for

15:54:25  16       the purpose of presenting its losses, GHU has expressed

15:54:29  17       its claim in the actual currencies in which those losses

15:54:33  18       were incurred or would have been incurred.

15:54:38  19           The claim, therefore, on all those premises that

15:54:41  20       I have explained, is as set out in appendix 11,

15:54:45  21       paragraph 18, to GHU's opening submissions.  So loss of

15:55:09  22       profit, 244 million, less €198 million saved;

15:55:16  23       development loss, sterling £48 million, less euros saved

15:55:20  24       of 21.7 million, and in total losses in sterling

15:55:25  25       £292 million, less euros saved of €219 million.


                                           145
15:55:35   1   LORD GRABINER:  My Lord, it may be academic, and we will

15:55:37   2       suggest that it will be, my learned friend a couple of

15:55:38   3       times today has repeated several times today the

15:55:41   4       244 million sterling figure.  He knows he has to give

15:55:46   5       credit off that figure of another 28 million sterling as

15:55:49   6       a result of the Court of Appeal ruling before this case

15:55:51   7       began.

15:55:58   8   MR McCALL:  My Lord, my learned friend I think is right.

15:56:00   9       That's subject to a deduction in respect of income tax

15:56:04  10       rebates which are not going to be claimable.  My Lord,

15:56:15  11       in the submissions, just to capture that, that is dealt

15:56:18  12       with on internal pages 168 and 169, paragraphs 23 and

15:56:23  13       24.  I thank my learned friend for pointing that out.

15:56:34  14           My Lord, just to complete the picture, there is also

15:56:40  15       Carey's claim for repayment under the loan agreement,

15:56:43  16       which I mentioned briefly.

15:56:44  17   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Just a moment, is that all on damages?

15:56:46  18   MR McCALL:  Yes.  Carey's claim for repayment under the loan

15:56:50  19       agreement, that's dealt with in appendix 15 of GHU's

15:56:55  20       opening submissions.  My Lord, as I mentioned earlier

15:56:59  21       today, Carey is claiming €55.4 million from GHU under

15:57:06  22       the loan agreement, and that includes interest of

15:57:09  23       €4.3 million from 28 December 2007 to 23 December 2009.

15:57:15  24           Now, the issue for present purposes, apart from the

15:57:18  25       other issues we discussed earlier, is whether or the


                                           146
15:57:24   1       extent to which Carey is required to give credit for

15:57:27   2       monies which it received under a performance bond taken

15:57:30   3       out by GHU, provided by Houston Casualty Europe, as part

15:57:36   4       of the overall security package for the loan, and the

15:57:40   5       actual bond is in core bundle 1, page 214.

15:57:45   6           I understand, but I may be wrong about this, that

15:57:49   7       although it doesn't expressly say so, Carey seems to

15:57:52   8       accept that in principle it is required to give

15:57:54   9       credit -- and no doubt you will be addressed about

15:57:57  10       that -- but there are issues on Carey's part about the

15:58:01  11       exact amount and the timing.

15:58:02  12           The position is this: Carey has received the sum of

15:58:06  13       €21 million, €21.103 million under the bond following

15:58:14  14       some proceedings in Spain --

15:58:16  15   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Well, I've read that.

15:58:18  16   MR McCALL:  You have seen that, so GU says that Carey must

15:58:21  17       give credit for that sum, less a very small adjustment

15:58:25  18       which Carey has accepted it has to repay.

15:58:28  19   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  There is an appeal pending on --

15:58:30  20   MR McCALL:  Yes.  To make that position good, it would

15:58:36  21       obviously be wrong, in our submission, if Carey was able

15:58:38  22       to recover more in total under its counterclaim than

15:58:41  23       that which it had advanced under the loan with interest,

15:58:44  24       and its already received back €21 million.  What Carey

15:58:49  25       says is that the question of whether any credit needs to


                                           147
15:58:51   1       be given can't be resolved while there is the appeal

15:58:54   2       pending by Houston Casualty in Spain, and therefore

15:58:59   3       there is uncertainty about the prospect that Carey may

15:59:04   4       have to repay the monies it's received from

15:59:07   5       Houston Casualty.

15:59:10   6           GHU's position on that is that Carey has received

15:59:12   7       the money, it has to give credit for monies which it has

15:59:16   8       actually received, it's not affected by the fact

15:59:24   9       Houston Casualty is seeking to bring a further appeal in

15:59:25  10       Spain, and that is the position.  Your judgment must

15:59:26  11       take account, in my submission, of the money that is

15:59:28  12       held today by Carey.

15:59:33  13   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  They have got the money and have been

15:59:35  14       asked to repay it.

15:59:36  15   MR McCALL:  I think that's the substance of it.

15:59:36  16   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  We can sort that out.

15:59:40  17   MR McCALL:  Yes.  Finally there is a claim against GU under

15:59:43  18       the guarantee.

15:59:44  19   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  As I understand it, those issues are

15:59:46  20       essentially gone because it's accepted that the

15:59:51  21       liability is coterminous; is that right?

15:59:54  22   LORD GRABINER:  As far as we are concerned, yes.

15:59:56  23   MR McCALL:  Yes.

15:59:57  24   LORD GRABINER:  You are talking about the GU guarantee?

16:00:03  25   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Yes.


                                           148
16:00:04   1   MR McCALL:  My Lord, in that case I have nothing more to say

16:00:04   2       about that.  That is right.

16:00:05   3           Unless I can help you further, those are my

16:00:07   4       submissions.

16:00:08   5   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Thank you, thank you very much.

16:00:14   6           Lord Grabiner, I expect you would like to start

16:00:17   7       tomorrow morning?

16:00:18   8   LORD GRABINER:  I am actually very happy to start, and I can

16:00:20   9       deal with a couple of points quite briefly if your

16:00:21  10       Lordship is happy to sit for another few minutes.

16:00:22  11   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Certainly.

16:00:24  12   LORD GRABINER:  I would find that helpful.  I have quite

16:00:26  13       a lot to get through tomorrow.

16:00:28  14   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Yes.

16:00:30  15   LORD GRABINER:  Obviously I would like to try to achieve

16:00:31  16       that.

16:00:32  17               Opening submissions by LORD GRABINER

16:00:33  18   LORD GRABINER:  First of all, may I say that I am going to

16:00:37  19       be showing your Lordship a number of documents in the

16:00:40  20       course of my opening.  For the most part those documents

16:00:46  21       are already in your Lordship's core bundle.  Insofar as

16:00:49  22       they are not, we will provide you with a schedule and

16:00:53  23       the extra documents coming from the main run of the

16:00:58  24       trial documents, and they will be put into the core

16:01:00  25       bundle as we go.  But we will provide your Lordship with


                                           149
16:01:04   1       those documents, so to speak, raw hard copy tomorrow.

16:01:08   2   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  So there will be a pile of documents

16:01:10   3       there, and as you go through, I'll take them and put

16:01:14   4       them into the core bundle?

16:01:16   5   LORD GRABINER:  Precisely.

16:01:16   6   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  It has actually has been quite useful to

16:01:16   7       have some assistance with renumbering and that kind of

16:01:20   8       thing.

16:01:21   9   LORD GRABINER:  What your Lordship will not be able to do is

16:01:23  10       to do some on the spot renumbering.

16:01:26  11   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Exactly.

16:01:28  12   LORD GRABINER:  Because there will be other documents

16:01:30  13       probably that will come into the sequence.  But we do

16:01:33  14       know that we have the benefit of the trial bundle

16:01:36  15       numbering, so even if there are gaps between documents

16:01:38  16       they will at least be in chronological sequence in the

16:01:41  17       core bundle for the time being.

16:01:44  18   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Yes.  I mean, even one or two documents

16:01:47  19       today, I think there is still one to go in, isn't there,

16:01:51  20       but one way or another we will manage and that will make

16:01:54  21       it easier.

16:01:55  22   LORD GRABINER:  My Lord, yes.

16:01:58  23           I would quite like to start, unless your Lordship

16:02:01  24       would --

16:02:02  25   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Certainly.


                                           150
16:02:02   1   LORD GRABINER:  Very good, I am grateful.

16:02:03   2           My Lord, we say this is one of those cases where the

16:02:07   3       arguments presented by the parties are like ships

16:02:11   4       passing in the night, and we do respectfully suggest

16:02:14   5       that the other side never grapple with the real issues

16:02:18   6       in this case.  For example, a key question in the case

16:02:23   7       is whether GHU was in default in June 2008 when, as is

16:02:30   8       common ground, Losan refused to advance what would have

16:02:34   9       been the third subsequent tranche payment under the

16:02:39  10       December facility.

16:02:40  11           Now, your Lordship knows that Losan advanced the

16:02:43  12       first and second tranches in the euro equivalent of

16:02:47  13       30 million sterling on 28 December, 15 January; we then

16:02:56  14       advanced €4.1 million on 2 April 2008, and €3.4 million

16:03:03  15       on 5 May, and they were the first and second subsequent

16:03:09  16       tranche payments.

16:03:11  17           The third subsequent tranche payment would have been

16:03:14  18       in respect of work done in April payable in June, and

16:03:19  19       that's the tranche payment that we declined to pay.

16:03:24  20       Now, the amount of the payment was determinable in

16:03:27  21       accordance with the machinery in the loan agreement and

16:03:30  22       in the SPA, and the mechanism is quite important for

16:03:35  23       evidential reasons that we will come to later.

16:03:38  24           In a nutshell, IDOM, who were Urvasco's Spanish

16:03:46  25       based project managers, who had a small London office,


                                           151
16:03:49   1       were obliged to produce the Employer's Agent Report that

16:03:52   2       my friend has made reference to.  EAR it's shortened to.

16:03:56   3           The EAR was then subject to evaluation by G&T,

16:04:00   4       Gardiner & Theobald.  They were the monitoring surveyors

16:04:03   5       for Losan.  G&T had their defined function under the

16:04:10   6       SPA, and they were obliged to certify the amount payable

16:04:15   7       under the loan agreement, and the way that that was done

16:04:17   8       was that they would look at the EAR and then they would

16:04:23   9       perform the validation role, and it was against their

16:04:28  10       certification that the payment was to be made.  There

16:04:31  11       was a dispute resolution process in the event that there

16:04:34  12       was a dispute between IDOM's EAR and G&T's

16:04:42  13       certification, but that procedure was never invoked at

16:04:48  14       any time in the lifetime of the bargain.  As

16:04:50  15       your Lordship knows, the subsequent tranche payments

16:04:52  16       which would, but for, we say, GHU's default, have been

16:04:56  17       payable in respect of April, May and June, and they

16:05:00  18       would have been payable in June, July and August, were

16:05:03  19       never paid and then in October, Losan cancelled the

16:05:08  20       contract.

16:05:09  21           Now, it's obvious that the key question in this

16:05:11  22       context is whether there was a default as of

16:05:14  23       6 June 2008.  That is a date when, according to GHU,

16:05:22  24       this particular tranche should have been paid.  Now, the

16:05:31  25       answer to this question -- and this is equally


                                           152
16:05:32   1       obvious -- will depend on the events which happened

16:05:33   2       between 31 December 2007 and the beginning of 2008 and

16:05:38   3       that is why we have focused our attention on that period

16:05:41   4       in our preparation and in particular in the outline

16:05:44   5       argument which your Lordship has seen.

16:05:46   6           By contrast, from passing references -- I mean,

16:05:51   7       apart from passing references -- there is little or no

16:05:54   8       mention of the events or the critical facts about this

16:05:58   9       period in the outline arguments which we have seen from

16:06:02  10       the other side.  So that's really the first ships

16:06:06  11       passing in the night point, and it's an extremely

16:06:09  12       revealing one, in our submission.

16:06:13  13           Next, there is a complicated disclosure story here,

16:06:16  14       I don't want to get bogged down in the nonsense of it,

16:06:19  15       because it's all now irrelevant.  If your Lordship would

16:06:23  16       be kind enough just to take up our written opening

16:06:26  17       bundle, there is a schedule at the back which

16:06:32  18       your Lordship may not have paid much attention to, for

16:06:36  19       entirely understandable reasons.  It's schedule 18.

16:06:57  20           What has been happening here is that there is a mass

16:07:00  21       of material which has come across but on a piecemeal

16:07:04  22       basis in the disclosure process, and your Lordship sees,

16:07:12  23       if you look at appendix 18, the references is MB are

16:07:17  24       Mayer Brown, my solicitors, and you can see that we gave

16:07:23  25       substantive disclosure on 17 December, which is the


                                           153
16:07:27   1       third entry in the schedule, and if you were to do the

16:07:31   2       sums it comes there to about, whatever, 2,500 documents.

16:07:37   3       They are documents, not pages.

16:07:40   4           Although there are references thereafter to MB, they

16:07:44   5       invariably involve very few additional documents.  If

16:07:48   6       you go two pages on and just look at the dates between

16:07:54   7       14 September -- these are the entries very near to the

16:07:58   8       end of the third page -- to 15 October, my solicitors

16:08:04   9       provided another 460-odd additional documents.  I just

16:08:09  10       want to tell your Lordship something about that little

16:08:12  11       bit of the story.

16:08:14  12           What had happened here was that Mr Losada, who was

16:08:17  13       the disgraced former chief executive of LHW, which was

16:08:24  14       the managing company of the Losan group of companies,

16:08:28  15       had been the subject of a police investigation in Spain

16:08:33  16       and, as part of that investigation, the police had taken

16:08:36  17       possession of hard drives at LHW.  Carey had brought

16:08:43  18       proceedings in Spain in order to get hold of that

16:08:46  19       material for the purposes of this litigation here in

16:08:47  20       London, and I think also had gone on appeal on that

16:08:50  21       issue, but had been unsuccessful in those proceedings.

16:08:54  22           The material wasn't released until August of 2012.

16:08:59  23       It was duly disclosed over the dates that your Lordship

16:09:02  24       sees reference to at the end of that schedule, and GHU

16:09:08  25       then made a very wide-ranging disclosure to


                                           154
16:09:11   1       Mr Justice Flaux at the end of September, which was

16:09:14   2       rejected, and described by the learned judge as

16:09:18   3       a monumental fishing expedition.

16:09:23   4           If you look at the rest of the schedule, and in

16:09:26   5       particular if you go back to the beginning, you will see

16:09:30   6       in the very first entry that the disclosure given by GHU

16:09:34   7       was 4,500 documents, also on 17 December, the very first

16:09:42   8       entry, but then gave disclosure on a continuing basis

16:09:45   9       all the way through, and as of now we are up to just

16:09:51  10       over 13,500 documents.

16:09:55  11           So the vast majority of the disclosure with which we

16:09:57  12       have been provided post-dates the date when it should

16:10:00  13       have been disclosed.  There may be some relevance in

16:10:03  14       some of that story, but it's important perhaps that

16:10:07  15       your Lordship should have an understanding of those

16:10:09  16       matters from the outset.

16:10:11  17           Can I deal with one other matter, my Lord?  Just

16:10:16  18       saying something about the period December 2007 through

16:10:18  19       to June 2008.  The disclosure given by GHU in respect of

16:10:26  20       that period tells us what happened in its gory detail.

16:10:32  21       What we learn is that at all material times GHU and the

16:10:36  22       Urvasco Group was in progressively desperate financial

16:10:42  23       straits.  These documents and this story would be

16:10:46  24       a perfect working example for a business school model of

16:10:50  25       the disastrous events of 2008, in particular in Spain,


                                           155
16:10:56   1       and the Spanish economy.  The Urvasco Group business

16:11:00   2       model consisted of its ownership of a large development

16:11:04   3       land bank, purchased with loans from more than 40

16:11:08   4       Spanish banks, so that it was heavily indebted to those

16:11:11   5       banks.  As at 31 December 2007, its indebtedness to

16:11:20   6       banks was €2.36 billion.  The reference on that is core

16:11:27   7       bundle 433, and we might look at it first thing tomorrow

16:11:35   8       but not now, and that was the total amount it had drawn

16:11:38   9       down by way of borrowings from its banks.

16:11:41  10           At the same time, it was engaged in the construction

16:11:44  11       and sale, having done the construction, of residential

16:11:47  12       accommodation on the land which formed the land bank.

16:11:52  13       Having borrowed money to buy the land, it also needed to

16:11:55  14       borrow more money to build the buildings on the land.

16:11:59  15           Now, that sort of formula is capable of working

16:12:01  16       successfully, provided there is a market for the

16:12:04  17       purchase of the apartments, and banks willing to

16:12:08  18       continue their lending.  What happened was that the

16:12:20  19       market collapsed, credit dried up, and this is something

16:12:22  20       which, I mean, your Lordship can take judicial notice

16:12:23  21       of, this is not a complicated proposition but there is

16:12:24  22       plenty of evidence in the papers to precisely that

16:12:29  23       effect.

16:12:29  24           There was a corresponding collapse in land values

16:12:31  25       and the contemplated construction works either never


                                           156
16:12:34   1       happened or had to be abandoned.  There were other parts

16:12:37   2       of the group's business.  First of all it managed hotels

16:12:40   3       in Spain, the development in London with which we are

16:12:45   4       concerned in these proceedings was a brand new venture.

16:12:48   5       They had never built a hotel anywhere else in the world,

16:12:52   6       and the hotel on the Aldwych was the first time they

16:12:56   7       ever undertook such an exercise.  It involved the

16:13:00   8       Urvasco Group building that or undertaking to build the

16:13:05   9       hotel outside Spain, and the theory was that it would

16:13:08  10       then be managed by Hoteles Silken, which is another

16:13:14  11       company within the Urvasco group.  The other asset that

16:13:17  12       it had was a valuable wind farm business,

16:13:20  13       Urvasco Energia, and your Lordship has heard something

16:13:23  14       about that, and I'll have something to say about that

16:13:26  15       myself.

16:13:27  16           Perhaps just in the remaining moments, if

16:13:29  17       your Lordship, because it's in the core bundle, would be

16:13:31  18       kind enough just to have a look at core bundle,

16:13:36  19       page 433.

16:13:46  20           If anyone is concerned or interested, it's also in

16:13:50  21       E16 at page 43.  {E16/43} I'll try, where possible, to

16:13:57  22       give both references so they will appear on the

16:14:00  23       transcript.

16:14:04  24           This shows this huge list of lending banks, and you

16:14:11  25       can see in the middle column that the amount drawn is


                                           157
16:14:15   1       €2.3 billion, the limit being not much more than that,

16:14:21   2       probably a couple of hundred thousand euros.  Then

16:14:25   3       I think what happens down the right-hand side is that

16:14:27   4       there is a -- I am not quite sure how that works --

16:14:32   5       proportion of the global debt explained by reference to

16:14:36   6       each particular bank.  We certainly know that the

16:14:40   7       biggest bank lender was BBVA.

16:14:43   8           So your Lordship has a flavour of the number of

16:14:46   9       banks and the amount of money at stake.  Your Lordship

16:14:49  10       will also see at the top "as at 31 December 2007".

16:14:56  11           My Lord, for me, that would be a convenient moment,

16:14:59  12       and I'll obviously do my very best to complete tomorrow,

16:15:05  13       which I am sure that I will do.

16:15:08  14   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Yes.  Well, thank you both very much.

16:15:13  15       Just in terms of the mechanics, then, of getting the

16:15:17  16       core bundles managed, there is some management that

16:15:21  17       remains from today which will kindly be done when

16:15:25  18       I rise.  You will produce the separated out stuff you

16:15:31  19       are going to refer to during the day, and I think that

16:15:35  20       would be helpful on your side as well, Mr McCall, when

16:15:39  21       it comes to cross-examination and so forth.  Someone,

16:15:46  22       I have a very kind volunteer at present, or someone from

16:15:53  23       the other side, it doesn't really matter who, will need

16:15:56  24       to assist with the mechanics of getting pages numbered

16:15:59  25       and so on and so forth.


                                           158
16:16:01   1   LORD GRABINER:  My Lord, we will sort that out.

16:16:04   2   MR JUSTICE BLAIR:  Right.  Until tomorrow.
