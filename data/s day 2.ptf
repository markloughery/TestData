4=Opening Submissions by MR KINNEAR (continued)
5=        More testing morning session test testTHE CHAIRMAN:  Good morning.  We have a timetable here have 
6=    we?
7=MR KINNEAR:  A hard copy of the timetable.
8=THE CHAIRMAN:  Excellent.  Let's just have a look.
9=        Is the position that we have the competition appeal 
10=    tribunal to 17th January?  Is that the position?
11=MR KINNEAR:  I think it is the 10th sir, possibly.
12=THE CHAIRMAN:  Is it?  So that we've to make special 
13=    accommodation for ...
14=MR KINNEAR:  The last three weeks of January effectively.
15=THE CHAIRMAN:  Except you said not sitting 20th to 24th and 
16=    as far as closing submissions are concerned we don't 
17=    have to have a huge court.  Do we?  We could do those 
18=    here?
19=MR KINNEAR:  Yes, we will have to have the system again.
20=THE CHAIRMAN:  Of course but we don't have to have a huge 
21=    court.
22=MR KINNEAR:  Yes.  I think certainly my preference would be 
23=    as long as we need to have somewhere, anywhere is better 
24=    than nowhere in order to get the case finished 
fmt=pb
25=    effectively.
26=THE CHAIRMAN:  I don't think will be possible to get the 
27=    case finished with nowhere.
28=MR KINNEAR:  Exactly.  That is my point.
29=THE CHAIRMAN:  I know, but I think if we can for example 
30=    book this court that would be fine.
31=MR KINNEAR:  Yes.
32=MR PATCHETT-JOYCE:  Or possibly the court downstairs sir 
33=    which I think is even bigger.
34=THE CHAIRMAN:  That is the Lands Tribunal court isn't it?  
35=    Enquiries can be made.  It's the 1 # 3rd to 17th January 
36=    and the 27th to 31st January.  Court 5 if possible.
37=MR PATCHETT-JOYCE:  My learned friend was saying about three 
38=    weeks maybe block the whole three weeks out might be 
39=    sensible because if we go short by a day or long by 
40=    a day.
41=THE CHAIRMAN:  Yes, good idea.  So we will start from the 
42=    13th --
43=MR KINNEAR:  The timetable sir as we have always said it 
44=    a movable feast.  Hopefully we can go a bit faster 
45=    and finish a bit sooner.
46=        Sir, one other matter of housekeeping as well.  
47=    Obviously the transcripts each day are download on to 
48=    the system, so if you are looking for transcripts you 
49=    will find them in the Opus system.
fmt=pb
50=THE CHAIRMAN:  Yes, I think I did ask for paper wonder 
51=    actually as well.
52=MR KINNEAR:  You would like paper ones.
53=THE CHAIRMAN:  Yes I have been given them for the pre-trial 
54=    review and I haven't actually got one for today but it 
55=    has been emailed to me but I would rather be saved the 
56=    trouble of printing it out.
57=MR KINNEAR:  Mr Sharp may I ask if you would like them in 
58=    hard copy as well.
59=MR SHARP:  Electronic is fine for me.
60=MR KINNEAR:  Obviously if there is at any stage you and 
61=    Mr Sharp need in hard copy --
62=THE CHAIRMAN:  I would like to build up a file of hard copy 
63=    transcripts.
64=MR KINNEAR:  I think there will be quite a few files 
65=    probably by the end.
66=THE CHAIRMAN:  Maybe.  We will see.  ^ heading) .
67=MR KINNEAR:  Sir, we had reached page 44 yesterday in the 
68=    opening submissions document [SUB/44] and I had just 
69=    finished dealing with a visit on 7th September 2005.
70=        The next item is at paragraph 128.  On 
71=    12th December 2005 Officer Mercott and Johal visited 
72=    Megantic at the offices of Fairfax, that is the address 
73=    at Gerrards Cross and if we bring up on the screen, 
74=    please, bundle [370/322] and down to the next page 
fmt=pb
75=    please [370/323] we will see again Officer Mercott, 
76=    Mr Johal visit at 45 to 47 Station Road, present were 
77=    Mr Ash, director, Mr Ross, director of finance, 
78=    Howard Nicholson trading -- role given as trading 
79=    manager, Adam Nicholson as trading manager, and then can 
80=    we go forward --
81=THE CHAIRMAN:  Was this before Mr Brookfield got involved.
82=MR KINNEAR:  This is still -- this is just over a month 
83=    before Mr Brookfield becomes involved.  His directorship 
84=    commencing on 23rd January of 2006.
85=THE CHAIRMAN:  I'm sure there is a date -- 12th December.
86=MR KINNEAR:  12th December sir right at the top and the body 
87=    of the report, the comments, the notes from the report, 
88=    are at page [370/325]
89=THE CHAIRMAN:  Just to chuck in something Mr Sharp 
90=    and I were discussion.  I don't think we do wouldn't it 
91=    annotate this particular document but if during the 
92=    evidence we wanted to' no I at a time a document -- 
93=    presumably you will show a document to a witness like 
94=    this and if we then wanted to annotate the document 
95=    which we probably will at that point it will be 
96=    necessary for us to call it up I think on to our screen 
97=    which will take a little time so you are happy to be 
98=    patient with that.
99=MR KINNEAR:  Of course.
fmt=pb
100=THE CHAIRMAN:  Okay.  I'm not quite sure how we will do that 
101=    but don't worry about that at the moment.  We will 
102=    manage to do that.
103=MR KINNEAR:  Obviously if you need some more assistance from 
104=    Opus in relation to --
105=THE CHAIRMAN:  We will, but we will get that at the 
106=    adjournment.
107=MR KINNEAR:  So we can see that the meeting had been 
108=    requested by Mr Ash as a result of the concerns over the 
109=    length of time had had taken to release VAT repayments.  
110=    There is clearly general discussion takes place in the 
111=    third paragraph with both Mr Nicholsons, who outline 
112=    their current procedures and due diligence checks and 
113=    there is further discussion, really the point I want to 
114=    bring out of this is the fact that due diligence and 
115=    IMEI numbers were discussed again not fourth paragraph:
116=        "I informed them it would help if I received the 
117=    purchase and sales spreadsheet and the IMEI spreadsheet 
118=    earlier as there was considerable checking to be carried 
119=    out which all takes time.  I currently have to lift the 
120=    box and although the numbers from inspection reports 
121=    before validating the numbers it would be helpful in 
122=    these were also put in a spreadsheet."
123=        Final paragraph:
124=        "At the conclusion of the meeting I remove sized the 
fmt=pb
125=    joint and several provisionings invalid invoice 
126=    procedures."
127=        So that is the visit on 12th December and clearly 
128=    what we are seeing from this there was a continue Yule 
129=    dialogue virtually benefit those officer of the 
130=    appellant and officers of the Revenue.
131=        As I have just said, on 23rd January 2006 
132=    Mr Brookfield is appointed, and according to his notes, 
133=    and his witness statement, he bctsd 100 per cent 
134=    shareholder having purchased the company.  And the next 
135=    contact thereafter --
136=THE CHAIRMAN:  He purchased it from Mr Ross.
137=MR KINNEAR:  From Fairfax Gerrard Holdings, yes.  That was 
138=    Mr Ross' company, yes.
139=THE CHAIRMAN:  Mr Ross' company, yes ^punc.
140=MR KINNEAR:  The next document to bring up please, volume 
141=    [31 # 8/53] and we looked yesterday, sir, at some 
142=    letters relating to some input tax in relation to 
143=    the 05/04 period which had been denied and this is 
144=    a letter from Mr Broers this time to Mr Allan of 
145=    Dorsey & Whitney stating that he had completed his 
146=    review their case following the ECJ's judgment in the 
147=    Bond House case, and in light of guidance given this 
148=    judgment, and the information I no I have I can confirm 
149=    that I authorised that amount to be repaid."
fmt=pb
150=        ^q and he says further down:
151=        "The repayment of input tax is without prejudice to 
152=    any further enquiries or action that the Commissioners 
153=    may take, please consider whether this action has any 
154=    impact on your direct tax position ..."
155=        Et cetera, he is.
156=THE CHAIRMAN:  So they got their tax back for 05/04 --
157=Q.  We looked at the correspondence yesterday and we sought 
158=    input tax had been dye denied on the basis of the 
159=    non-economic activity argument, come March 2006 the ECJ 
160=    judgment has been released, and that argument knowing 
161=    can be run by HMRC ^ speaker) so the money has been 
162=    repaid?
163=THE CHAIRMAN:  We know that later on 04/06 was repaid 
164=    following Dr Bryce's dismissal of the -- alowfght 
165=    appeal.
166=MR KINNEAR:  Those direction from recollection in June of 
167=    2008, so -- I don't know the exact date --
168=THE CHAIRMAN:  Can you just tell me what, if anything, was 
169=    done in relation to the periods between 06/04 and 0 # 
170=    4/06?
171=MR KINNEAR:  Between -- they were all repaid.  They are all 
172=    repaid.
173=THE CHAIRMAN:  Were they withheld -- originally initially 
174=    withheld and then repaid.
fmt=pb
175=MR KINNEAR:  No.
176=THE CHAIRMAN:  They were just repaid.
177=MR KINNEAR:  They were repaid.  I think --
178=THE CHAIRMAN:  Timeously?  At the time that the Megantic 
179=    expected them to be repaid.
180=MR KINNEAR:  No I think there was some delay.  I think 
181=    I did -- we looked at the schedule yesterday.  Do you 
182=    recall the schedule with phase 1, phase 2, and phase 3 
183=    and I think it actually says on to --
184=THE CHAIRMAN:  That was the very large schedule?
185=MR KINNEAR:  No it was just across two pages.  It was the 
186=    one that gave the summary of each VAT return.
187=THE CHAIRMAN:  Yes, I do remember.
188=MR KINNEAR:  That details how much the repayment was in 
189=    relation to each return but each repayment was remade.  
190=    These were the only ones prior to 04/06 where input tax 
191=    had actually been denied.
192=THE CHAIRMAN:  I see.  That is useful to know.
193=MR KINNEAR:  The next document, please, is [315/18] it's 
194=    a letter dated 25th April.  This time it is from 
195=    an officer we don't need to look at the second page yet 
196=    from candy styles ^punc and it says:
197=        "As you may note investigation of MTIC fraud 
198=    continues to be Customs top fraud priority department 
199=    will continue to tackle the criminals behind this type 
fmt=pb
200=    of fraud."
201=        There is more detail about that:
202=        "I am writing to you because as a result of our 
203=    enquiries in respect of your 01/02 VAT claim ..."
204=        I think I think that is an error and it should be 
205=    01/06:
206=        "... in respect of your 01/02 VAT claim we note 
207=    of 40 transaction selected for verification two 
208=    commenced with defaulting traders and resulting in the 
209=    loss of Rev yew ^reads full details of your sales that 
210=    resulted in a loss of revenue are as follows."
211=        There are transactions listed and it continues:
212=        "As explained in notice 7236 where you have 
213=    genuinely done everything you can to check the integrity 
214=    of the supply ^reads that VAT may go unpaid and no other 
215=    reason to suspect VAT would go unpaid the joint and 
216=    several liability measure will not be applied to you.  
217=    However if you knew or had reasonable grounds to suspect 
218=    that VAT would if unpaid ^ paid then the measure can be 
219=    applied to you from your records you will be able to 
220=    ascertain who supplied you with the goods detailed above 
221=    and you may wish to consider what appropriate action is 
222=    needed to ensure that the VAT does not go unpaid in 
223=    respect of any future transactions for the avoidance of 
224=    doubt I should finally tell you this letter is without 
fmt=pb
225=    prejudice to any enquiries Customs may be making or have 
226=    made into actions with which you have already been 
227=    involved and which are in chain of transactions where 
228=    VAT has gone unpaid."
229=        ^q so in our submission the appellant 45B --
230=THE CHAIRMAN:  For two out of 40.
231=MR KINNEAR:  Two out of 40 and that fraud is obviously -- 
232=    VAT fraud is obviously a priertd we are continuing our 
233=    investigations.
234=        Next document, please, is in the same bundle 
235=    [315/48] a short letter from Mr Mercott, 
236=    26th April 2006, HMRC informing the appellant:
237=        "Would you please note for the purposes of verifying 
238=    your future returns commencing with the April return the 
239=    Commissioners will require sight of all original export 
240=    documentation whilst original documentation is not 
241=    always been requested in the past, it has always been 
242=    the Commissionaries right to request this due to the 
243=    increase in fraudulent use of these documents, it has 
244=    become necessary to examine all originals."
245=        So this is the time we saw yesterday when the 
246=    appellant's trade was increasing very substantially and 
247=    at the same time they are being written to by officers 
248=    of the Revenue saying the amount of fraud that we are 
249=    encountering is increasing, and as a result we are 
fmt=pb
250=    asking you to provide original documentation which we 
251=    hadn't always done so in the past.
252=        The appellant did in fact in relation to April 
253=    provide the Commissioners with the originals as 
254=    requested for the April return but in relation to 
255=    the May and June returns, not all of the original 
256=    documentation was supplied and we will see a letter 
257=    later on which gives an explanation -- certainly 
258=    a partial explanation for why that took place.
259=        On 5th May 2006 -- we don't need to turn it up -- 
260=    Mr Ashford to HMRC a spread sheet listing the 
261=    transactions in support of the April 2006 VAT return and 
262=    then if we turn, please, to [370/318] it's a further 
263=    letter to the appellant from the Commissioners, this 
264=    time dated 1 # 19th May 2006:
265=        "As you know the investigation of MTIC ..."
266=        The same paragraph as before in relation to 
267=    the amount of fraud and then 2 continues:
268=        "I'm write ^ writing to you because as a result of 
269=    our enquiries in respect of your 01/06 VAT claim we know 
270=    that of the 40 transactions selectsed for verification 
271=    a further deal commenced with a defaulting dealer 
272=    and resulting in the loss of revenue exceeding 
273=    420,000 ..."
274=        We can see below in fact --
fmt=pb
275=THE CHAIRMAN:  That becomes 3 out of 40 #.
276=MR KINNEAR:  That becomes 3 out of 40 and in fact although 
277=    it doesn't say so in this letter the suppliers in this 
278=    deal were -- there were two suppliers in fact 
279=    Svenson Commodities and Powerstrip obviously two of the 
280=    first line contra-traders.  It may become an issue later 
281=    on --
282=THE CHAIRMAN:  Those were the direct suppliers to Megantic.
283=MR KINNEAR:  To Megantic, yes, in these trades.  Of course 
284=    we know from the out lie ^-- correction outline I gave 
285=    that they continued to trade with those entities.
286=THE CHAIRMAN:  Do we know whether Mr Mercott on 
287=    11th May 2006 was talking about tax loss through 
288=    contra-trading?
289=MR KINNEAR:  May I just my back for a while?  It was direct 
290=    tax loss at that stage, sir.
291=THE CHAIRMAN:  Is the Commissioners' position now that in 
292=    relation to those deals that we are talking about those 
293=    are one of the few, the very few -- no of course it is 
294=    not --
295=MR KINNEAR:  It is not our period.  It is not even the April 
296=    period so we are talking about the turn of the year, 
297=    talking about January 2006.
298=THE CHAIRMAN:  I see.  Yes.
299=MR KINNEAR:  Volume 369/113] please ^ref 24th May, a further 
fmt=pb
300=    letter, paraphrasing HMRC wrote to the appellant 
301=    informing it that the 04/06 return was to be subjected 
302=    to extended verification.  It says that in the second 
303=    paragraph:
304=        "Period of time will now be required for 
305=    HM Revenue & Customs to undertake a verification of the 
306=    transaction to which the claim relates before 
307=    a repayment can be authorised this will involve the make 
308=    of enquiries with other VAT registered traders 
309=    concerning the supply and movement goods concerned, 
310=    I can confirm that these enquiries have now commenced.  
311=    This is of."
312=        There is repetition thereafter the summary of the 
313=    difficulties that HMRC were --
314=THE CHAIRMAN:  Does that mean 02/06 and 03/06 weren't 
315=    subjected --
316=MR KINNEAR:  They were not.  There would have been some 
317=    verification but the extended verification which has led 
318=    to the majority of the appeals that are going through 
319=    this Tribunal, the majority of the extended verification 
320=    began in relation to the 04/06 periods.
321=THE CHAIRMAN:  Why was -- what was the problem -- how did 
322=    the investigation of the 01/06 period start then?
323=MR KINNEAR:  There was some verification but I think the 
324=    term "extended verification" means there were more 
fmt=pb
325=    resources being put into it and ^inaudible scrutiny of 
326=    all --
327=THE CHAIRMAN:  As a result of Commissioners finding out 
328=    there was a connection with tax loss on 3 out of 40 
329=    deals in 01/06 I don't know there might have been more, 
330=    was there a denial of input tax.
331=MR KINNEAR:  There was not no,.
332=THE CHAIRMAN:  There wasn't.  Thank you.
333=MR KINNEAR:  On 2nd June 2006 Mr Ashford to the Revenue 
334=    a spreadsheet listing this time the transactions in 
335=    support of the May 2006 VAT return and then on 5th 2006 
336=    volume [316/41] again this time Officer Broers writes 
337=    requesting records, VAT period May 2006:
338=        "I acknowledge receipt of your email dated 2nd June 
339=    containing a spreadsheet of your May VAT break down like 
340=    your previous return please could you send me copies of 
341=    your deal packs and the original export documentation to 
342=    sport May 2006 period."
343=        There is also some requests for information in 
344=    relation to January 2006.  Next document, please, 
345=    [315/84] this is a letter dated 12th June 2006.  It is 
346=    a relatively lengthy letter, from Mr Mercott again, runs 
347=    for I think three pages, and within this he asks Mr Ash 
348=    to supply a large -- faiivelgt large amount of material.  
349=    I'm not going to go through at all of it but number one:
fmt=pb
350=        "Of the 142 sales packs ... ."
351=        Talking about the April 2006 return:
352=        "... 87 have signed supplier declaration letters 
353=    stating that 25 per cent IMEI or box and lot numbers are 
354=    available on request."
355=        The box and lot numbers relate to CPUs and the IMEIs 
356=    relate to mobile phones:
357=        "This implies the goods must have been scanned and 
358=    that the numbers are available as this forms part of the 
359=    transaction contract I request a listing of the IMEI 
360=    numbers or box and lot numbers associated with the 87 
361=    sales invoice.  If these are forgot available then 
362=    please explain why not."
363=        Number 2:
364=        "Invoices (list as number N (indicate a request to 
365=    the straight company for inspection and 100 per cent 
366=    IMEI scan invoice 853 requests a 10 per cent IMEI scan 
367=    the inspection report submitted indicate that a scan was 
368=    not carried out I request a list of the IMEI box numbers 
369=    as scanned."
370=        So general requests in relation to IMEI numbers.  
371=    There is a further request in relation to that on the 
372=    next page, [315 #/85] at paragraph 12 finishes:
373=        "If no IMEI check has been carried out how can you 
374=    state you have not previously traded the same goods?"
fmt=pb
375=        Again on the next page, [315/86] paragraph 32 again, 
376=    it says in relation to -- lists a number of invoices:
377=        "Purchase order states 'to be supplied with a full 
378=    list of IMEI numbers' please supply listing of IMEI 
379=    numbers or explain their omission."
380=        And amongst this letter there are a number of 
381=    requests for information in relation to a number of 
382=    specific invoices I'm not going to read them all out.  
383=    Below 36 it again emphasises the point of the that has 
384=    been made on a number of occasions there has been 
385=    a dramatic increases of sales within your trade second 
386=    for the VAT loss through missing trader intra-community 
387=    fraud continues to rise in line with that increase the 
388=    Commissioners of Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs have 
389=    a responsibility to protect the Revenue and will 
390=    continue to respond proportionally to that increased 
391=    risk I realise this is a dawnltsding list of queries 
392=    however I am sure being fully aware of the VAT loss and 
393=    risks within the trade sector you will understand in the 
394=    need for a thorough verification and audit of the trade 
395=    in respect of in that period."
396=        ^q ^chk can we move on, please, to [315/87] I'm just 
397=    going to touch on this because I am going to come back 
398=    to it as one full subject later.  This is effectively 
399=    a response to the letter that we just looked at.  It is 
fmt=pb
400=    from Dorsey & Whitney.  The appellant's representatives 
401=    at this stage.  It is to Mr Mercott and we see it is in 
402=    response to:
403=        "Thank you for your letter dated 1 # 29D June 2006.  
404=    Whilst we are miles that had your verification process 
405=    has progressed ..."
406=        Et cetera.  If we go down to the next page, please 
407=    which is page 88 ^ref they begin to address the points 
408=    raised on 12th June letter, one by one.
409=THE CHAIRMAN:  That was the long letter.
410=MR KINNEAR:  That was the long letter we just looked at so 
411=    this is effectively a point by point response.
412=THE CHAIRMAN:  Three days later.
413=MR KINNEAR:  Three days later, yes.  Number 1:
414=        "On 20th February 2006 we wrote to Mr Letters to 
415=    inform him that as a result of the changes in industry 
416=    practices, and the mawnt mounting administrative strain 
417=    as ^reads not record the IMEI numbers."
418=        And I said I'm not going to look at this letter in 
419=    any more detail at the moment but it does deal with ...
420=THE CHAIRMAN:  Sorry where is the point about the IMEI 
421=    numbers.
422=MR KINNEAR:  That was number 1, sir, first three and a half 
423=    sentences.  I'm going to come back to that in just a few 
424=    minutes in any event.
fmt=pb
425=THE CHAIRMAN:  So what they say is they have told them three 
426=    months -- four months previously that they had decided 
427=    not to record the IMEI numbers so why was he asking for 
428=    them again.
429=MR KINNEAR:  Sir I am going to come back and look at just 
430=    that -- the correspondence in relation to that 
431=    particular issue of the IMEI numbers some time this 
432=    morning in any event in a little more detail.
433=        The next document, please is [369/116] a further 
434=    letter, this time from Mrs Hirs to the appellant, again 
435=    at the Gerrards Cross address:
436=        "I refer to the repayment claim submitted by the 
437=    company for the period 31st May 2006 period of time will 
438=    now be required for Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs to 
439=    undertake a verification of the transaction."
440=        So effectively just like they are in relation to 
441=    the April deals the appellant is being informed there is 
442=    going to be a verification exercise in relation to 
443=    the May transactions, and a similar paragraph again in 
444=    relation to the prevalence of MTIC fraud.
445=THE CHAIRMAN:  So this is our first period?
446=MR KINNEAR:  This is the first period yes, sir, May 06.  
447=    Just one further in relation to correspondence at this 
448=    point and it starts at bundle [315/22] and between 
449=    22nd July 2004 and 30th June 2006 the appellant was sent 
fmt=pb
450=    19 -- what I call veto letters informing them that 
451=    numerous UK and EU-based companies had been 
452=    de-registered for VAT and you can see the first one 
453=    there it relates to a company called Midas.  I'm not 
454=    going to take you through them now burden they are all 
455=    listed after that particular document if you --
456=THE CHAIRMAN:  Were these companies ones that Megantic had 
457=    traded with directly?
458=MR KINNEAR:  No.
459=THE CHAIRMAN:  They weren't.
460=MR KINNEAR:  They are not by and large.  I just need to 
461=    check that sir but by and large certainly they were not.
462=THE CHAIRMAN:  So did everyone in the industry get these 
463=    letters, I mean on Midas for instance.
464=MR KINNEAR:  The way in which the letters were generated was 
465=    if a company had either made a request to verify a VAT 
466=    number or that company had made a request to verify 
467=    their VAT number everyone who had done the verification 
468=    on the VAT number would receive one of these letters.
469=THE CHAIRMAN:  So the link was the Redhill verification.
470=MR KINNEAR:  Yes, there was a database at red hiel hill they 
471=    recorded every verification that was made so if Megantic 
472=    had verified Midas' VAT number --
473=THE CHAIRMAN:  Or ^overspeaking.
474=MR KINNEAR:  Or vice versa, everyone --
fmt=pb
475=THE CHAIRMAN:  I wouldn't have got one of these letters.
476=MR KINNEAR:  No.
477=THE CHAIRMAN:  I don't remember getting one.
478=MR KINNEAR:  Everyone who tried check the VAT number or 
479=    vice versa would have received one of these letters.  
480=    The next visit to look at, sir, is a visit on 18 
481=    #th July 2006 and the report can be found at [315/105] 
482=    the last of the transactions, sir, that this appeal is 
483=    concerned with took place on 20th June of 2006.  So this 
484=    meeting is taking place within a month of that final 
485=    transaction.
486=        We can see at the top the 18th July 2006, 11.10 #, 
487=    it is at Dorsey & Whitney's offices, reason for the 
488=    visit to offer to meet the trader and their 
489=    representatives in HMRC letter dated 13th July in 
490=    response to Mr Allan's letter which had threatened 
491=    judicial review both letters have been captured EF --
492=THE CHAIRMAN:  The threat of judicial review which -- we did 
493=    look at that letter I don't remember that presumably 
494=    that was on the basis that the requests from too 
495=    burdensome was it.
496=MR KINNEAR:  We haven't looked at that letter, sir, but 
497=    I think the threat of judicial review was on the basis 
498=    that the repayments hadn't been made.  Because in normal 
499=    circumstances obviously the repayments are made within 
fmt=pb
500=    30 days of the VAT return being lodged but they weren't 
501=    obviously in this case because of the extend 
502=    verification exercise.
503=        Present at the meeting HMRC officers Lelliott, 
504=    Mercott and brokers the appellant represented by Mr Ash, 
505=    Mr both Mr Nicholsons and Mr Brookfield.  And then 
506=    a number of representative solicitors or otherwise from 
507=    Dorsey & Whitney.
508=        If I can just ... I'm again not going to go through 
509=    all of it sir, number one you can see that Mr Allan who 
510=    is the partner from Dorsey & Whitney asked at the 
511=    beginning of the meeting if the monies -- the 
512=    outstanding repayments were going to be released, and 
513=    Mr Lelliott said no.  Certainly not today in any event 
514=    as he was asked.  There is discussion at number 2 about 
515=    the verifications that had taken place to date.  Number 
516=    3 Mr Allan ^sp states he is confident his client is not 
517=    involved in fraud.  4 he asks how far the enquiries were 
518=    going with the chains.  At 6 Mr Howard Nicholson asked 
519=    about the position re the 13 per cent of the transand 
520=    that is had been traced to missers.  Mr Mercott 
521=    mentioned Cellular solutions and also mentioned further 
522=    down verification lines.
523=        At 7 Mr Howard Nicholson attacked HMRC EU 
524=    verification strategy, Mr Nicholson used news print to 
fmt=pb
525=    make a point about EU checks, Mr Howard Nicholson 
526=    arguing no VAT loss in the chain, therefore HMRC have to 
527=    repay.  He also argued EU verification waste of time --
528=THE CHAIRMAN:  Before we get on to waste of time, he is 
529=    making the point is he at that stage that if the chain 
530=    is clean then the money ought to be repaid.
531=MR KINNEAR:  Certainly that is -- certainly our submission 
532=    is that is the interpretation that --
533=THE CHAIRMAN:  The chain that Megantic is involved --
534=MR KINNEAR:  Yes.
535=THE CHAIRMAN:  If they had done the verification they found 
536=    that the chain that Megantic is involved in it clean.
537=MR KINNEAR:  Yes.
538=THE CHAIRMAN:  Then they ought to repay the money.
539=MR KINNEAR:  Yes.  Effectively we submit that he is 
540=    advancing a submission that if there is no defaulting 
541=    trader at the beginning of the chain i.e. it is not 
542=    traced it a defaulting trader then HMRC have to repay.  
543=    Again, it will be a matter for consideration and further 
544=    evidence on that point later on exactly what he meant or 
545=    how or why he was advancing that particular proposition.
546=        Number 12 says:
547=        "Letter dated 29th June from Roger Mercott ..."
548=        There are some queries within there.  About five 
549=    lines down it is recorded:
fmt=pb
550=        "Howard Nicholson said some deals are aborted which 
551=    HMRC are unaware and have if the customer still wants 
552=    stock then they sell it even if they are aware that it 
553=    is damaged,."
554=        Then assist something which is put in as a quote:
555=        "We only buy stock what we can sell it never hold 
556=    stock just match deals."
557=THE CHAIRMAN:  I suppose it is matter of evidence but if 
558=    they have a cancelled deal prowm presumably the stock 
559=    comes back to them.
560=MR KINNEAR:  I think that will be a matter for evidence.  
561=    The general tenor of what Mr Nicholson and the others 
562=    involved say is that effectively they acted in a way 
563=    with a -- where they matched up --
564=THE CHAIRMAN:  I'm sure they did.
565=MR KINNEAR:  -- customers and suppliers.
566=THE CHAIRMAN:  But it sometimes goes wrong ^chk.
567=MR KINNEAR:  I think we would submit what he's saying is we 
568=    never buy it until we know we can sell it and when we 
569=    look at the way in which payments are made the appellant 
570=    virtually always received payment from its customer 
571=    before it made the payment to its supplier.  We will see 
572=    that when we look at the FCIB evidence a little later.
573=        Again it is a long note I'm not going to go through 
574=    any more of it at the moment.  But within the body of 
fmt=pb
575=    the note it was agreed that a further meeting would take 
576=    place on 25th July so a week later, in order to discuss 
577=    issues relating to due diligence.  The report relating 
578=    to that meeting can be found within the same bundle 
579=    [315/138] again we can see the date at the top, attended 
580=    by officers Mercott and Broers, attended on behalf of 
581=    the appellant Mr Ash, Mr Brookfield, both Mr Nicholsons 
582=    and Mr counsel Kelsey, we can see the roles arid to each 
583=    Mr Ash and Mr Break field recorded as being directors of 
584=    Megantic Services Adam Nicholson as the director of 
585=    Caledonian and Howard Nicholson as the director of MSG.
586=        If we go ^ we go down please to page 140 ^ref there 
587=    is a discussion in the first main paragraph about export 
588=    documentation.  In the second paragraph the first few 
589=    lines there is a discussion Mr Brookfield raises the 
590=    issue, an alarming issue that the expenses for the 04/06 
591=    return have been paid into the wrong bank account.  
592=    Mr Mercott was given a copy of the on line banking 
593=    confirmation to confirm and there is more information 
594=    about that.
595=        But seven lines down --
596=THE CHAIRMAN:  What does that actually mean?  That 
597=    the expenses of that return had been paid into the wrong 
598=    bank account?
599=MR KINNEAR:  I will be corrected if I am wrong but 
fmt=pb
600=    I understand what took place sir was that the input tax 
601=    was denied in relation to the transactions but in 
602=    relation to any ancillary business expenses where there 
603=    was a claim for the repayment of input tax that that 
604=    install -- much smaller amount would have been repaid.
605=THE CHAIRMAN:  So that he -- he's not really talking about 
606=    the expenses he's talking about the VAT on the expenses?
607=MR KINNEAR:  I believe so.  I will just confirm that is 
608=    absolutely correct but I think it is.  Yes.  What I said 
609=    is right.
610=THE CHAIRMAN:  That is just an administrative matter.
611=MR KINNEAR:  Yes, administrative matter.  As I said, seven 
612=    lines down that paragraph there is a discussion about 
613=    bank accounts and it says:
614=        "On the subject of bank accounts it was established 
615=    that up and to April 2006 the main UK can the had been 
616=    with the co-operative bank, Megantic had then changed 
617=    accounts to the FIBI Bank of Israel only to find they 
618=    did not provide any on line bank facilities they have 
619=    now changed to Bank of Ireland details given by 
620=    Chris Ash Steven Brookfield Megantic also have 
621=    a Nationwide deposit account and a Credit Suisse deposit 
622=    account, the main trading account is held with FCIB 
623=    First Curacao Roger Mercott asked if a copy of the FCIB 
624=    bank statements would be sent with any monthly deal 
fmt=pb
625=    sheets so HMRC could trace the intra-account details.  
626=    Howard Nicholson said they would also put deal numbers 
627=    next to the payments to assist HMRC with this task."
628=        There is then a query, a question, how does Megantic 
629=    operate?  Both Steven Brookfield and Chris Ash are at 
630=    present directors of Megantic Services limited ^ limited 
631=    with David Waddington as company secretary, 
632=    Steven Brookfield has replaced David Ross by buying him 
633=    out of business, Mr Waddington on an accountant has 
634=    replaced Mr Syed Ali, Megantic Services has only two 
635=    people on the payroll Steven Brookfield and Chris Ash 
636=    the day-to-day deals receipts contracted out to 
637=    Caledonian in Salford Quays of which Adam Nicholson is 
638=    the director, Steven Brookfield explained that KPMG had 
639=    assisted Megantic in setting up Megantic Services
640=    (Gibraltar) Limited who in fact pay Caledonian 
641=    Consulting Limited Howard Nicholson confirmed that he is 
642=    a director of Megantic Services (Gibraltar) Limited 
643=    since April 2005.  Steven Brookfield said he would put 
644=    something in writing to explain this set up and was 
645=    requested that he should be provide copies of any 
646=    arrangement contracts as proof.  Steven Brookfield also 
647=    mentioned that in a previous role he worked for KPMG in 
648=    their tax investigations department, so understood why 
649=    we were asking certain questions regarding business set 
fmt=pb
650=    up et cetera."
651=        ^q and we looked yesterday at the short document 
652=    that Mr Brookfield sent as a result of that particular 
653=    conversation.
654=THE CHAIRMAN:  What was the -- you could for the record say 
655=    what the file reference is.
656=MR KINNEAR:  Yes, sir.  Just give me one second.  I will ask 
657=    for it to be brought up on screen very briefly.
658=MR PATCHETT-JOYCE:  [317/42]
659=MR KINNEAR:  I am grateful to Mr Patchett-Joyce.  Yes, that 
660=    is exactly the one.  It's the next page in fact, 
661=    [317/43]
662=THE CHAIRMAN:  Thank you very much.
663=MR KINNEAR:  We looked at this yesterday.
664=THE CHAIRMAN:  Yes, I remember.
665=MR KINNEAR:  If we go back, please, to [315/138] ^-- 
666=    correction 140] how does Megantic operate?  We looked at 
667=    this, towards the bottom of paragraph it says:
668=        "Steven Brookfield said he was always aware from 
669=    Adam Nicholson that Caledonian had recently received 
670=    a routine VAT assurance visit and claimed HMRC are aware 
671=    of this set up and that all is okay.  Steven Brookfield 
672=    said the money movements between Megantic Services
673=    (Gibraltar) and Megantic Services employment in the form 
674=    of loans which would not show up on the VAT returns.  
fmt=pb
675=    Mr Brookfield confirmed that other than Chris Ash there 
676=    is no longer a requirement for Megantic to be located at 
677=    the Gerrards Cross office.  Mr Mercott said he would 
678=    discuss the issue with his senior officer as there may 
679=    be an opportunity change the current set one trader 
680=    meetings ..."
681=        I think the significance of that was if the office 
682=    was no longer the Gerrards Cross office but was 
683=    an office in Salford Quays it may mean that a different 
684=    HMRC office would deal with the VAT returns.  
685=    Mr Brookfield mentioned that he wants to grow the 
686=    business and diveers fie into new areas he referred to 
687=    his statement regarding this matter in our previous 
688=    meeting on 18th July.  Steven confirmed from advice 
689=    taken from people in the City there is potential that 
690=    the company could float on the stock market, however 
691=    this is all on hold due to HMRC's action.  To withhold 
692=    the 04/06 and onward returns he added that the July 06 
693=    return will not be very high and later in the meeting 
694=    remarked that no significant trading had occurred 
695=    in July."
696=        ^q next paragraph is entitled --
697=THE CHAIRMAN:  Is that borne out by the facts?
698=MR KINNEAR:  There was a very small amount of trading 
699=    in July of 2006.
fmt=pb
700=THE CHAIRMAN:  That is after our period isn't it.
701=MR KINNEAR:  It is after our period.  Under "due diligence":
702=        "Steven Brookfield confirmed that Megantic Services 
703=    undertake a number of checks on all their suppliers they 
704=    requested all their suppliers complete a trade 
705=    application form and provide sertsdz of incorporation 
706=    and VAT registration and copies of a letter headed 
707=    paper."
708=        That sir we would submit is when one looks at the 
709=    documentation, held by all of the companies in these 
710=    chains, is the standard pack of introductions.  So 
711=    certificate of incorporation, VAT registration, letter 
712=    of introduction.  We will see that in a number of packs 
713=    and we will see it also in the context of what I term 
714=    "Operation Ghast" evidence later on when we look at some 
715=    material that was found on C defence.   , it seems to be 
716=    a standard pack of material that was always sent.
717=        Next a follow-up visit is undertaken, normally by 
718=    Dave Evans who is the due diligence manager at 
719=    Caledonian and was once a police officer.  Sometimes 
720=    Adam Nicholson or Steven Brookfield will undertake 
721=    a visit to the supplier if required.  Steven Brookfield 
722=    confirmed that Dun & Bradstreet or Checksure roorms are 
723=    also under obtain ^ taken together with Equifax reports 
724=    so credit checks effectively is what he's saying, he 
fmt=pb
725=    said:
726=        "Copies of rental leases are requested and pictures 
727=    taken of the premises and directors and copies of 
728=    passports are sometimes taken.  Steven added that trade 
729=    references asked for usually from freight forwarders but 
730=    said that although third party references are also 
731=    requested usually from accountants and banks these are 
732=    a lot harder to obtain so not always received."
733=        There is further talk about due diligence, page 
734=    [315/142] Mr Brookfield was -- first main paragraph:
735=        "Mr Brookfield was keen to acknowledge Megantic were 
736=    adhering to public Notice 726."
737=        And there is more discussion about due diligence.  
738=    In the next paragraph Mr Nicholson said, 
739=    Howard Nicholson said, that:
740=        "Overall the due diligence process filtered out 
741=    suppliers and customers whom he claimed Megantic will 
742=    not trade with."
743=        So he -- they are effectively saying in our 
744=    submission: we have a very rigorous due diligence and by 
745=    applying that due diligence we hope to filter out all of 
746=    the suppliers and customers who we won't trade with, for 
747=    whatever reason.  If they don't meet our tests, which we 
748=    would submit beg the question, if they imposed this very 
749=    rigorous due diligence system, it was very unlucky that 
fmt=pb
750=    they then went on to conduct 488 deals in April, May 
751=    and June which traced back to tax loss.  Obviously our 
752=    case is that it is not a coincidence, and that they knew 
753=    that their transactions were connected with fraud.
754=        Page [315/143] please.  Under the heading "Deal 
755=    matching":
756=        "Howard Nicholson explained that a day-to-day trade 
757=    something controlled via an online bespoke computer 
758=    system known as batch sales system which Chris Ash said 
759=    was written in SQL especially for Megantic when 
760=    a telephone call is received from or made it a customer 
761=    requiring stock --
762=THE CHAIRMAN:  Do you know what SQL means.
763=MR KINNEAR:  I don't.  I don't want to give evidence but 
764=    I suspect it is some sort of computer code or computer 
765=    language:
766=        "... when are a telephone call is received from or 
767=    made to a customer requiring stock the details of the 
768=    call are taken and enter into the database.  The same 
769=    process is then followed when a supplier rings up or is 
770=    contacted and it is established that they can provide 
771=    stock."
772=        So it looks like what happens is customers call in 
773=    and suppliers call in and likewise Megantic -- what they 
774=    are saying is we call suppliers and we call customers, 
fmt=pb
775=    all of this information is put on to the database, and 
776=    then it continues:
777=        "The database will automatically pair up 
778=    like-for-like stock entries and if the conditions are 
779=    favourable, this information is highlighted on screen 
780=    and the Megantic sales team will then commence the deal.  
781=    Mr Brookfield said that from their database Megantic are 
782=    able to see what the going rate or market price is for 
783=    a particular item is each day."
784=        So what they are saying is effectively we ring out, 
785=    people ring in we put this all --
786=THE CHAIRMAN:  Yes it could be customer initiated and it 
787=    could be supplier initiated.
788=MR KINNEAR:  Yes, and in both directions, sir, so what they 
789=    are saying it could be us, Megantic, ringing a customer 
790=    or it could be the customer ringing us, or it could be 
791=    the supplier rings us or it could be us Megantic ringing 
792=    the customer.  We are getting enquiries and we are 
793=    chasing leads ourselves.  We are putting it all into the 
794=    computer and then the computer matches everything up, 
795=    and we are able to do the deals.
796=        Well, we submit, sir, again same point as I have 
797=    just made.  F that truly was the case it was desperately 
798=    unlucky every time they matched up a deal, and certainly 
799=    very lucky for the fraudsters behind this, that every 
fmt=pb
800=    time the computer matched up a deal it did so in a way 
801=    which allowed the goods and the funds to travel --
802=THE CHAIRMAN:  The question is as we will have to discover 
803=    is how it was they chose the people to ring up or how it 
804=    was that -- the particular people rang them up.
805=MR KINNEAR:  Yes.
806=THE CHAIRMAN:  The pool of trading partners is important.
807=MR KINNEAR:  Yes.  I am going to make a point in relation to 
808=    that a little later but I will make it now, because it 
809=    ties in.  When one turns to -- if you turn to appendix H 
810=    within the bundle, please.  We looked at it briefly 
811=    yesterday.
812=THE CHAIRMAN:  Appendix H.  ^ref.
813=MR KINNEAR:  The two loms on the ^-- correction columns on 
814=    the right-hand side show all of suppliers and all of the 
815=    customers during the April to June periods.  There 
816=    are --
817=THE CHAIRMAN:  April to June.
818=MR KINNEAR:  Yes, there are 39 suppliers, sir, and 56 
819=    customers.  The reason why I draw your attention to the 
820=    sheer number of those is that, of course, one could 
821=    see -- one could envisage a circumstance where a trader 
822=    carries out one or two deals which are traced back to 
823=    a fraudulent tax loss and they may be able to advance 
824=    a case which the Tribunal might accept that they have 
fmt=pb
825=    been some way manoeuvred into those deals by their 
826=    supplier and customer on either side.  In fact I think 
827=    you yourself, sir, made a finding similarly to that in 
828=    the case of he will see where there were only ^sp four 
829=    or five deals in that case and I think what the held you 
830=    couldn't rule out the possibility that that could have 
831=    been taken place.  ^ Else) we accept that but when one 
832=    is tinning to look at 39 suppliers and 5 # 5 customers 
833=    ^chk so that is nearly one hundred counterparties we 
834=    submit to suggest that you were duped and manoeuvred 
835=    into these deals, 488 deals, by nearly one hundred 
836=    counterparties simply doesn't stand up to any scrutiny.
837=        Particularly when the company as Megantic was, was 
838=    being operated by men who were chartered accountants and 
839=    had vast experience across a number of different types 
840=    of business, and in ticket mobile phone trade.  It is 
841=    simply incredible -- it would be incredible to come to 
842=    such a conclusion or even to put such a case forward.
843=        Back if we may, please, to the note which we were 
844=    looking at at [315/143] there is discussion at the bftd 
845=    page about VAT loss joint and several warning letters, 
846=    Mr Broers, I'm not going to look at it again.  This is 
847=    one of the documents sir I would invite you to look at 
848=    in more detail when you have some reading time rather 
849=    than me reading the whole thing out.
fmt=pb
850=        As I say, at the bottom then, page [315/144] there 
851=    is then a discussion about due diligence and a number of 
852=    files were requested.  The officers say that access can 
853=    be given.  Page [315/145] details some information about 
854=    insurance, Mr Ash said that he would provide Mr Mercott 
855=    with a copy of their freight insurance.  He mentioned 
856=    the goods were insured at 110 per cent of net cost price 
857=    of goods.  Mr Brookfield confirmed that Megantic's 
858=    acco 
859=    account mass ars.  Annual accounts.  Mr Brookfield said 
860=    the only set of audited annual accounts he could provide 
861=    from for ^reads he said of as 6 next week week 
862=    commencing 31st July 2006 the auditors were coming to 
863=    undertake accounts for 2005."
864=        ^chk and finally Mr Mercott asked what the position 
865=    is in respect of the May and June deal records.  
866=    Mr Brookfield said the May records from were virtually 
867=    complete and that most of the June records were also 
868=    ready.  He asked anded that Megantic was having trouble 
869=    obtaining some CMR records but said given the issues 
870=    involved in the April return wanted to make sure he gave 
871=    HMRC everything in one go.
872=        So it is clearly a detailed meeting, sir.  You can 
873=    see at the bottom of that page that the officers leave 
874=    the premises at 12.55.  I think at the beginning it said 
fmt=pb
875=    the meeting started at 10.45 so there is something in 
876=    excess of to hours of discussions in relation to the 
877=    various trades.
878=        There is, sir, considerable correspondence as you 
879=    can imagine between the Revenue and the appellants 
880=    thereafter in relation to the extended verification 
881=    exercise and requests for repayment.
882=        That correspondence is not in our submission 
883=    particularly relevant to the issues that you have to 
884=    decide and therefore I'm not going to take you to any of 
885=    it now, if the box relevant later on of course it is 
886=    within the bundle.
887=        We referred to these particular visit reports 
888=    because they are very soon after the he event and thish 
889=    awses to what had gone on are discussed in some detail.
890=THE CHAIRMAN:  What paragraph are you in your ...
891=MR KINNEAR:  At [SUB/147] ^-- correction 140] it is 
892=    a document relating to 17th August, it's at page 
893=    [315/178] I just deal with this because I mentioned it 
894=    before.  It is 17th August 2006 a letter from Dorsey, 
895=    Mr Alan whose name we have seen as attending a number of 
896=    the meetings:
897=        "Dear Mr Mercott thank you for your letter dated 
898=    3rd August addressed to our client please note at this 
899=    point all the original export documentings you have 
fmt=pb
900=    requested is still with the freight forwarders, and 
901=    there are substantial bills that need to be settled 
902=    before the freight companies will release the original 
903=    export documentation.  Furthermore you have requested 
904=    supporting documentation ..."
905=        Et cetera:
906=        "We would like to remind you you are clearly in 
907=    possession of all the information required for the 04/06 
908=    period and you still have not repaid the monies that 
909=    were due for this period as set out above ^reads in turn 
910=    means the dowlgtings is not being released."
911=        So it would certainly appear at this stage 
912=    in August 2006 the appellant has run out of money of th.  
913=    Clearly it claims it is owed tens of millions of pounds 
914=    by the Revenue but it is unable to even meet its freight 
915=    forwarder bills at that stage to get original 
916=    documentation.
917=        Sir, the next heading is one I touched on at the 
918=    close of play yesterday and that is the decision not to 
919=    record the IMEI numbers but I want just to pull the 
920=    documents from that particular strand together.  We 
921=    start, please, at [315/77] and we looked at this 
922=    document yesterday.  It is the visit report on 
923=    7th September 2005 by officers sounders and Broers ^sp 
924=    to at this stage Fairfax Gerrard at 45-47 Station Road 
fmt=pb
925=    present are Mr Ash director and Mr Nicholson consultant.
926=        And if we go, please, to the next page you will 
927=    recall the portion I drew to your attention yesterday in 
928=    the middle of the page:
929=        "Why are IMEI obtained?  In order to check for 
930=    circularity of goods numbers are processed by 
931=    an in-house database to ensure phones previously sold 
932=    had not been repurchased 100 per cent of IMEI numbers 
933=    are checked and there has been instances where deals 
934=    have been rejected on the grounds that MS, 
935=    Megantic Services, has previously sold the phones."
936=        So at that stage the appellants as I said yesterday 
937=    are clearly recording and checking IMEI numbers for good 
938=    reason, we would submit, given the response that was 
939=    given at that particular meeting about duplication.
940=        The next document then, please, is [315/91] again we 
941=    looked at this letter before.  I think we did anyway.  
942=    20th February 2006 from Mr Allen:
943=        "Dear Mr Broers we write in relation to the new 
944=    measures proposed by the commercial as detailed in your 
945=    press release dated 27th January 2006.  We believe your 
946=    proposal for introducing a reverse charge procedure for 
947=    transaction of VAT registered business trading in 
948=    certain goods has the potential to be far more effective 
949=    than previous measures applied."
fmt=pb
950=        Of course that measure didn't come in for some time, 
951=    I think it was September 2006 when that measure came in.  
952=    But the second paragraph:
953=        "As you know, we are continuously reviewingor 
954=    practices and procedures and obviously with the 
955=    proposals mentioned above a complete overhaul of the 
956=    system will be due in the future.  What we wish to 
957=    currently achieve is a sensible system producing only 
958=    necessary information 20 enable you to verify the 
959=    returns without the need for vast amounts of 
960=    documentations that currently being produced the level 
961=    of documentation requested imposes a enormous strain on 
962=    the business of our client as a result of time involved 
963=    to collate the information not to mention the 
964=    difficulties which sometimes arise which sending a team 
965=    it scan products to that end for example we have now 
966=    stopped taking the IMEI numbers as we are aware that in 
967=    the industry as a whole these are not normally taken and 
968=    with the level of turnover it is not possible to take 
969=    them.  We trust the above is self-explanatory are a if 
970=    you would like to have a meeting to discuss we we would 
971=    more than happy to do so."
972=        We know from the figures there is an exapplication, 
973=    again, another increase in the A trade that 
974=    the appellant is carrying out in relation to mobile 
fmt=pb
975=    phones and we submit that far from being the obvious 
976=    thing to do, that is to stop recording IMEI numbers, if 
977=    you are beginning to trade more or higher volumes of 
978=    phones and carry out more deals there is even more 
979=    reason to carry out IMEI number recording exercise that 
980=    you can compare to make sure you have not sold or are R 
981=    not selling the same phone twice as you have done not 
982=    purposes and.  And discovered that you have been sold 
983=    the same phone twice.
984=        I am the response to this letter is from the Revenue 
985=    in another letter [315/114] it's from Mr Mercott back to 
986=    fore at their address at 21 Wilson street.  There are 
987=    a number of paragraphs dealing with other matters, but 
988=    the fourth paragraph under the dark heading begins:
989=        "Regarding ..."
990=        It says:
991=        "Regarding the inspection and scanning of mobile 
992=    phones up until January your client.  Had inspections 
993=    carried out and provided the Commissioners with this 
994=    information as part of their due diligence checks.  This 
995=    has enabled your client to have an early indication as 
996=    to whether or not they have previously traded in the 
997=    same phones.  The Commissioners view this as a prudent 
998=    commercial check to carry out as part of the 
999=    due diligence procedure."
fmt=pb
1000=        Then there is a discussion in the next paragraph --
1001=MR PATCHETT-JOYCE:  Before we leave that page could we look 
1002=    at the third paragraph of it as well.  You started 
1003=    reading from the fourth.
1004=MR KINNEAR:  I will read it:
1005=        "In your letter dated 23, 2, 06 you state ^reads 
1006=    producing only relevant documents verification process 
1007=    I would point out that it is for the Commissioners to 
1008=    decide what documents are relevant to the verification 
1009=    process, and that all business records are subject to 
1010=    scrutiny by the Commissioners, we."
1011=        We submit that is simply Mr and Mr Mercott saying 
1012=    any business records that you do centre we are entitled 
1013=    to see.
1014=MR PATCHETT-JOYCE:  And the last sentence, please.
1015=MR KINNEAR:  "however ^reads IMEI numbers of mobile phone 
1016=    scanned and will take this into consideration in the 
1017=    verification process of the January 2006 VAT return."
1018=        Of course there is no dispute that the January 2006 
1019=    VAT return was repaid.  If we go to the next page, 
1020=    please [315/115] the first main paragraph:
1021=        "It is of course your client's decision as to what 
1022=    commercial checks they carry out, however, in the light 
1023=    of joint and several liability issues and other 
1024=    Community law it would seem a perverse decision to 
fmt=pb
1025=    reduce the level of due diligence checks."
1026=        So the Commissioners at this stage, they weren't 
1027=    requiring the total record the IMEI numbers, they 
1028=    couldn't do so but they were saying in relatively strong 
1029=    terms it seemed rather odd given the problems that you 
1030=    have had with IMEI numbers coming through twice in the 
1031=    past that you should now make this decision not to 
1032=    record them.
1033=        Volume [315/87] please.  That is letter that we just 
1034=    looked at, not more than ten or 15 minutes ago.  If we 
1035=    go to page [315/88] you will recall that first paragraph 
1036=    I true your attention to:
1037=        "The following points have been set out in 
1038=    accordance with the numbering used in your letter.  On 
1039=    20th February 2 240U6Z we wrote to Mr Broers informing 
1040=    him that as a result of changes in industry practices 
1041=    and the mounting administrative strain as a result of 
1042=    the level of documentation our client had decided not 
1043=    record the IMEI numbers this letter was copied to your 
1044=    colleague Candy Styles on 23rd February and you 
1045=    acknowledge receipt of those letters on 3rd marches as 
1046=    far as we are aware there had been ^reads IMEI numbers, 
1047=    and there is a general feeling in the industry and from 
1048=    various HMRC official that is IMEI numbers are not 
1049=    conclusion of evidence that the goods cannot be traded 
fmt=pb
1050=    again."
1051=        Our submission is nothing to do with the goods being 
1052=    traded again.  Of course the goods can be traded gone if 
1053=    you have recorded the IMEI numbers but recording the 
1054=    IMEI numbers allows you the appellant to know whether 
1055=    you have traded those goods beforings because if you 
1056=    have, it would be very odd.
1057=        It continues I'm not going to read the whole thing 
1058=    out again.  I have invited you already to consider that 
1059=    particular document in more detail when you complete 
1060=    your reading.
1061=        If we then go forward, please, to bundle [441/55] 
1062=    this document is -- it is entitle the "Megantic Services
1063=    Limited procedures manual" and it is exhibited by 
1064=    Mr Howard Nicholson in his statement to these 
1065=    proceedings.  You will see effectively you can -- again 
1066=    read through it at your leisure but effectively in our 
1067=    submission it is a quality control document listing the 
1068=    types of procedures that were to be carried out when 
1069=    conducting transactions for on behalf of Megantic 
1070=    Services Limited, appellant.  You can see if you look 
1071=    down just the headings there, you can the types of 
1072=    headings there are improvement report, purchase order 
1073=    template, customer declaration, supplier declarations, 
1074=    IMEI inspection request.
fmt=pb
1075=        If we just scroll done not next page, please 
1076=    [441/56]
1077=THE CHAIRMAN:  This is 9th November.
1078=MR KINNEAR:  9th November 2005, that is the issue date by 
1079=    the looks of things.  The second half of the first main 
1080=    paragraph begins:
1081=        "The priority is to ensure that Megantic Services 
1082=    commercial legal and financial risks are understood at 
1083=    all times during the trade, and that the process is 
1084=    backed up by a paperwork audit trail that complies with 
1085=    HMC note 726 and any other legal or statutory 
1086=    requirement."
1087=        Then it lists the main stages of the trade process, 
1088=    and the third from the bottom is:
1089=        "Check serial numberless."
1090=        HMCE and it refers to 3.10 and if we go down to 3.10 
1091=    ^chk.  In fact if we start at 3.9:
1092=        "Request inspection" it says:
1093=        "Fax the inspection request QF12 to the relevant 
1094=    freight forwarder or inspection company and request they 
1095=    perform a 100 per cent inspection and a 100 per cent 
1096=    serial number scan on the goods."
1097=        Then 3.10:
1098=        "Check the serial numbers the serial numbers in 
1099=    spreadsheet format will be forwarded by the freight 
fmt=pb
1100=    forwarder inspection company to the following email 
1101=    account, reports@meganticservices.com and uploaded into 
1102=    the batch sales system."
1103=        That is the sales system that we saw mentioned in 
1104=    the visit of the -- 18th July, and 25th July 2006.  We 
1105=    looked at earlier this morning.:
1106=        "During the upload error messages will be output 
1107=    when are a serial number is duplicated with an existing 
1108=    record in the database.  If there are no duplicate 
1109=    serial numbers and the inspection report is 
1110=    satisfactory, you should then fax the shipping request 
1111=    to the freight forward are."
1112=        So it seems that this was an automated system, the 
1113=    numbers are scanned presumably with a barcoder by the 
1114=    freight forwarder, the numbers are provided to Megantic 
1115=    in the form of a spreadsheet, the spreadsheet such 
1116=    loaded on to the batch sales system, and the batch sales 
1117=    system automatly with little input by the looks of 
1118=    things from any operator, automatically checks the IMEI 
1119=    numbers against those already recorded from previous 
1120=    deals, and flags uproar messages.
1121=        It says:
1122=        "If there are no duplicate serial numbers in the 
1123=    inspection report is satisfactory, you should then fax 
1124=    the shipping request to the freight forwarder, if 
fmt=pb
1125=    however some serial numbers are duplicated ..."
1126=        So clearly they are anticipating that they might be:
1127=        " ... then the trader is to request that further 
1128=    checks are made by the inspection company.  If after the 
1129=    second inspection verification of goods is not obtained 
1130=    then you must contact the supplier and seek 
1131=    an explanation must also advise Megantic Services 
1132=    directors of the situation."
1133=        So clearly within that document the problem of IMEI 
1134=    numbers coming through twice is anticipated and it is 
1135=    clearly flagged as being a major issue and something 
1136=    that had to be taken extremely seriously.
1137=        They had identified effectively for themselves the 
1138=    importance of recording the IMEI numbers but 
1139=    come February of 2006 it proceeded to ignore its own 
1140=    guidance.
1141=        So we submit in light of this chain of events and 
1142=    the contents of its own manual, the end of recording 
1143=    IMEI numbers is quite simply -- it is astonishing 
1144=    particularly given the huge growth in trade, huge growth 
1145=    in turnover and huge growth in profits.  It wasn't as if 
1146=    on the face of what was going on the appellant could 
1147=    no longer afford to do this.  By its own admission the 
1148=    appellant knew that such checks had in the past 
1149=    identified the carouselling of goods, and we submit the 
fmt=pb
1150=    reason that the appellant took the decision to no longer 
1151=    record the IMEI numbers is simple: it knew that it and 
1152=    other participants, other people who were participating 
1153=    in the fraud, were trading the same goods over and over 
1154=    again.  And that to record the IMEI numbers would only 
1155=    serve to provide HMRC with evidence of this and 
1156=    therefore it was easier not to record them.
1157=THE CHAIRMAN:  So what was the date when they stopped 
1158=    recording?
1159=MR KINNEAR:  The date of letter when they -- the date of 
1160=    notification was 20th February 2006.  So to the best of 
1161=    our knowledge and review of the papers there are no IMEI 
1162=    numbers for any of the deals relating to mobile phones 
1163=    that fall to be considered.  Is that a convenient 
1164=    moment.
1165=THE CHAIRMAN:  I think it is, sir.  We will take five 
1166=    minutes.
1167=MR KINNEAR:  Could we say ten minutes?
1168=THE CHAIRMAN:  Yes.
1169=(11.50 am)
1170=(A short break)
1171=(12.00 pm)
1172=MR KINNEAR:  Sir, we were into a new area now, and can 
1173=    we have open, please, [SUB/50] paragraph 154.
1174=        The next few pages I think I can take relatively 
fmt=pb
1175=    quickly, sir, because they are really paragraphs laying 
1176=    out a number of statistics which give the overview of 
1177=    the trade in the 04/05 and 06/06 periods.
1178=        04/06 VAT return which of course has now been 
1179=    repaid, received by HMRC on 2nd May 2006, recorded 
1180=    monthly sales of 82.6 million including sales to the EU 
1181=    of just under 58 million, made a --
1182=THE CHAIRMAN:  Does that mean the balance is in relation to 
1183=    buffer deals.
1184=MR KINNEAR:  Buffer deals, correct, sir, yes.  Claim for 
1185=    repayment just under 9.5 million which we know was 
1186=    allowed at the appeal against the -- the appeal against 
1187=    the denial of that was allowed by Dr Bryce in 2008.  
1188=    Extended verification commenced on 5th May 2006 and we 
1189=    give give threw a steer sir if you ever want to go to 
1190=    try to find all of the documents relating to the deals 
1191=    we give you a steer there as to which volumes they are 
1192=    in within the trial bundle.
1193=        Obviously breaks down to broker and buffer deals, 
1194=    the 99 broker deals in which the appellant purchased 
1195=    from a UK trader, and exported to the EU.  98 of the 99 
1196=    deals trace back either directly or through a single 
1197=    buffer to one of three contra-traders, David Jacobs, 
1198=    Powerstrip and Svenson Commodities, the remaining broker 
1199=    deal which was a CPU deal traced back to the defaulting

1200=    trader KEP 2004.  All the other deals involved mobile 
1201=    phones.
1202=        The buffer deals in 04/oh 0648 of them, three trace 
1203=    back to the contra-trader David Jacobs and two to 
1204=    Powerstrip, the remaining 43 trace back to 7 defaulting 
1205=    traders which we have listed at paragraph 158 I'm not 
1206=    going to read them all out for the time being.
1207=        05/06 VAT return received on 2nd June 2006 records 
1208=    sales for the month of just shy of 143.5 million 
1209=    including sales of just under 108 million to the EU, 
1210=    acquisitions from the EU were zero as they were in all 
1211=    three periods so no purchases by Megantic from outside 
1212=    of the UK.  And they claim for a repayment of just over 
1213=    18 million, extended verification commenced on 
1214=    2nd June 2006 and again in paragraph 160 we gave steer 
1215=    as to where the bulk of that material deal documentation 
1216=    can be found.
1217=        I dealt with 161 earlier on.  05/06 broker deals, 
1218=    157 broker deals, 151 of which have been traced back 
1219=    either directly or through one or two buffers to one of 
1220=    the six contra-traders, so in June we saw just 
1221=    David Jacobs, Powerstrip and Svenson, to those we see 
1222=    added Selectwelcome, Svenson Worldwide, and TCCS, the 
1223=    remaining six broker deals all which have relate to CPUs 
1224=    trace back to four defaulting traders Bullfinch, owe 
fmt=pb
1225=    indicated da, rez liewtions and 3D and the buffer deals 
1226=    in that period, there were 416 them, involving mobile 
1227=    phones and CPUs, some tracing back to contras you can 
1228=    see there one to David Jacobs five to Powerstrip and bun 
1229=    to Selectwelcome but the vast bulk of them tracing back 
1230=    to 8 defaulting traders again listed there, common names 
1231=    you will see repeating not just through Megantic's deals 
1232=    but also through the deals completed by the 
1233=    contra-traders.
1234=        The 06/06 VAT return received on 3rd July 2006, 
1235=    sales of just over 89 million, just under 62 million of 
1236=    which were to the EU, no acquisitions again, and a claim 
1237=    for a repayment of 10 million, so we can see the split 
1238=    there, sir of about two-thirds being broker deals and 
1239=    a third being buffer deals, or thereabouts in any event.  
1240=    Extended verification took place on 7th July and again 
1241=    a steer to the relevant correspondence and the place in 
1242=    the bundles where the deal packs can be found and again 
1243=    the break down, broker deals, 97 broker deals in June, 
1244=    95 all of which involve mobile phones trace back to five 
1245=    of the contra-traders, David Jacobs Powerstrip 
1246=    Svenson Commodities Selectwelcome and TCCS so the only 
1247=    one not present in June was Svenson Worldwide.
1248=        The remaining two deals involving CPUs trace back to 
1249=    three defaulting traders, the reason there are three is 
fmt=pb
1250=    because one of them was a split deal.
1251=        The 067/06 buffer deal 46 buffer deals 10 of which 
1252=    trace to three of the contra-traders the remaining 36 
1253=    trace to ten defaulting traders, again all listed there 
1254=    ^fg and just an overview comment really on the patterns 
1255=    of trade, there are we submit distinct patterns.  
1256=    Firstly 100 per cent of the broker deals involving 
1257=    mobile phones had been traced back to a contra-trader.  
1258=    100 per cent of the broker deals involving CPUs have 
1259=    been traced back to a defaulting trader, and one hundred 
1260=    permits of the non-mobile phone deals, that is CPUs, 
1261=    hard drives iPods have been traced directly back to 
1262=    a defaulting trader T would appear there were -- there 
1263=    may very well have been more than one orchestrated 
1264=    scheme, it appears there may have been one involving 
1265=    mobile phones and then another which involved sawps we 
1266=    will see again in more detail when we look at the FCIB 
1267=    that there are different companies involved at the head 
1268=    of those two distinctly different types of chains.
1269=        But we submit that the evidence shows that every one 
1270=    of the 488 deals has been traced back to a tax loss 
1271=    either directly to a defaulting trader or in the 
1272=    majority of the cases to one or more contra-traders 
1273=    which in turn traced to defaulting traders and we submit 
1274=    as I have said before that cannot abcoincidence.
fmt=pb
1275=THE CHAIRMAN:  Quite apart from it not being possible to be 
1276=    a coincidence, you say that the significance of the 
1277=    pattern that you have identified is that there may have 
1278=    been more than one guiding hand.
1279=MR KINNEAR:  Yes.  We submit when --
1280=THE CHAIRMAN:  Why raise point it weren't going to make 
1281=    that -- make a point on it.
1282=MR KINNEAR:  It looks like -- it looks we submit, the 
1283=    evidence suggestion, that there is more than one scheme, 
1284=    there is a scheme involving the mobile phones certainly 
1285=    with as I said Comica, and Parasail at both ends and 
1286=    then in relation to the CPUs there is another which 
1287=    involves a company called eastern at both ends and we 
1288=    submit that again it would be terribly -- really 
1289=    horrendous luck, so horrendous that it couldn't happen 
1290=    that every different type of good that you get into 
1291=    trading that every single one of your deals happens to 
1292=    trace back to a fraudulent tax loss.
1293=        Sir, paragraphs 172 through to 178 deal with issues 
1294=    relating to suppliers and customers, I think I made -- 
1295=    incorporated most of these points into some I made just 
1296=    before the break.  I mentioned 39 different suppliers.  
1297=    They are listed in appendix H.  Amongst the most common 
1298=    suppliers to the appellant were three of the six first 
1299=    line contra-traders Svenson 37 deals, David Jacobs 26 
fmt=pb
1300=    and Powerstrip 23.  All dealt with in appendix E and 
1301=    I have already made the points in the 173 I'm not going 
1302=    to make them again.  The point about the batch system 
1303=    and the way in which the deals were matched up and the 
1304=    fact that it couldn't abcould he ips dheans so many 
1305=    suppliers and customers had led back to a tax loss.
1306=        Again at 175 I deal with 5 -- we deal with the 56 
1307=    customers again.  At 176, 480 of the 488 deals both 
1308=    broker and buffer have been traced and shown to commence 
1309=    with ea. U supplier and ended with an EU or if a few 
1310=    cases an oversees customer.
1311=THE CHAIRMAN:  What is the significance of it being oversees 
1312=    rather than EU, do you know?
1313=MR KINNEAR:  The overseas customers relate to CPU deals as 
1314=    opposed to mobile phone deals so again there is 
1315=    a relatively distinct pattern.
1316=THE CHAIRMAN:  But so far as the working of the fraud is 
1317=    concerned it doesn't matter if -- does it matter --
1318=MR KINNEAR:  In terms of zero rating it doesn't matter 
1319=    because those transactions were zero rated as well, so 
1320=    there is the same claims --
1321=THE CHAIRMAN:  You are make the same point --
1322=MR KINNEAR:  Indeed.
1323=THE CHAIRMAN:  As regards the fact that it was mobile phones 
1324=    that were in the -- dealt with with contra-traders and 
fmt=pb
1325=    CPUs with direct --
1326=MR KINNEAR:  Direct default, yes.
1327=THE CHAIRMAN:  You are saying it was CPUs that ended up 
1328=    outside the EU.
1329=MR KINNEAR:  Yes.
1330=THE CHAIRMAN:  And mobile phones --
1331=MR KINNEAR:  Always remained within the EU, yes.
1332=THE CHAIRMAN:  Yes.
1333=MR KINNEAR:  177 is the point I have already made about 
1334=    the sheer number of suppliers and customers, and we 
1335=    submit that the circularity of payments is again 
1336=    relevant to the that.  Really for the same reasons 
1337=    because if they had been operating and selling at arm's 
1338=    length it is impossible that every single deal would 
1339=    have been able to trace back to a default, and that 
1340=    every single deal that had been examined would involve 
1341=    the circularity of funds.  Again, it is back to the 
1342=    point I discussed before, that if it happened once, you 
1343=    might be able to explain away, if it happened twice, 
1344=    well, more questions are being asked --
1345=THE CHAIRMAN:  It is the importance of being earnest.
1346=MR KINNEAR:  I think it is, yes.  That is a quote often used 
1347=    but I never quite remember the proper wording of it --
1348=THE CHAIRMAN:  I think to lose one parent is misfortune to 
1349=    lose two is carelessness.
fmt=pb
1350=MR KINNEAR:  And when you extend that out to the hundreds of 
1351=    deals across three periods we submit that the point is 
1352=    made.  The next main heading starts at page 58 [SUB/58] 
1353=    paragraph 179, again points I have already foreshadowed 
1354=    in relation to the existence of and an , stated scheme.  
1355=    We say it was a complex scheme and it required each 
1356=    party to play ply play a specific role in-chiefing the 
1357=    common aim.  Thing really goes back to the points we 
1358=    touched on yesterday but we say the appellant need not 
1359=    have known to full extent or details of the overall 
1360=    scheme.  Clearly it doesn't need to.  It would be very 
1361=    surprising if anyone in a scheme like this in our 
1362=    submission did know all of the details or certainly 
1363=    anyone other than a very small handful of people knew 
1364=    all of the details.
1365=        But we submit the appellant must surely have known 
1366=    to specific role that it was to play in the trading.  It 
1367=    is, though, I stress, sufficient for the Commissioners 
1368=    to prove that the appellant knew or should have known 
1369=    that its transactions were connected with a fraudulent 
1370=    tax loss.  We submit that the evidence that there was 
1371=    such an orchestrated scheme is -- from the evidence 
1372=    there is an overwhelming inference a such a contrived 
1373=    scheme existed.
1374=        We submit it goes one step further because we submit 
fmt=pb
1375=    that the existence, the evidence demonstrating the 
1376=    existence of the contrived scheme also provides very 
1377=    potent support for the assertion that the appellant knew 
1378=    of the connection with fraw.d it was in our submission 
1379=    essential for the fraudsters that they retained control 
1380=    over the goods, the paperwork relating to their sale and 
1381=    perhaps most importantly because fraud is about money, 
1382=    that they retained control of the money used to pay for 
1383=    them.  They quite clearly and demonstrably succeeded in 
1384=    that aim of the contrived transaction chains happened as 
1385=    planned with the goods and money circulating so they 
1386=    could be used in subsequent transactions, thereby 
1387=    generating ever greater tax charges.  The quicker the 
1388=    goods and the money circulate, the more transaction 
1389=    chains that can be completed and the more money that can 
1390=    be made.
1391=        We submit that the fraudsters, whichever parties 
1392=    were involved, they could not risk the intercession of 
1393=    an unwaiting third party who might sell the goods 
1394=    someone outside the fraud, thereby preventing its 
1395=    continuation.  Furthermore, with the substantial pool 
1396=    of companies as there clearly were in this case 
1397=    willingly and knowingly participating in the fraud and 
1398=    with significant to circulate).
1399=        Again there was simply no reason for the fraudsters 
fmt=pb
1400=    to draw in some unwaiting party or to dupe somebody.  In 
1401=    any event and in particular it would make no sense for 
1402=    them to allow a third party to act as broker trader 
1403=    because in effect that person is controlling at the end 
1404=    of the chain the repayments, and as I said yesterday the 
1405=    repayments, in our submission, is the fuel that funds 
1406=    the fraud.
1407=        You have the repayment and it is that money because 
1408=    we know that people were moat of not being paid until 
1409=    they are paid that is the money that effectively feeds 
1410=    its way back up both contra chain and the defaulting 
1411=    chain to allow each of the companies to make its profits 
1412=    or its turn.
1413=        We submit the organisers of this fraud were plainly 
1414=    not stupid.  They couldn't have been, to put in place 
1415=    a multi-million pound scheme and it is totally 
1416=    unthinkable, we submit that, they would ever have 
1417=    permitted the appellant to play such a central role in 
1418=    their fraud if it did not know that its transactions 
1419=    were connected with fraud.
1420=        The overall contra scheme, sir, is depictsed -- we 
1421=    looked at it yesterday and could question just turn it 
1422=    up again, please.  Appendix D.  [SUB/256] the following 
1423=    features can be seen from it.  Firstly, every single 
1424=    transaction chain started with an EU based trader.  
fmt=pb
1425=    Every single transaction chain bar a few as I say in the 
1426=    CPUs, but it is certainly in the mobile phones, every 
1427=    single transaction chain involved an acquisition by a UK 
1428=    based trader.  Of course this shows the contrascheme sir 
1429=    of which the CPU deals don't play a part because they 
1430=    are all direct default December.  Every time a UK trader 
1431=    made an acquisition from the EU it sold to the UK, east 
1432=    it never -- there is never a deal where a UK company 
1433=    buys from the E aw. then sells to the EU.  Not a single 
1434=    CPU or mobile phone remained within the UK not a single 
1435=    CPU or mobile phone has been traced it a manufacturer, 
1436=    retail outlet or end user in, that regard we submit 
1437=    transactions lack any commercial purpose and we submit 
1438=    the transaction chains were carefully designed with the 
1439=    sole purpose of ensuring that the transactions giving 
1440=    rise to the repayment claims did not trace as best as 
1441=    they could directly to defaulting traders, in an attempt 
1442=    to frustrate HMRC in detecting the fraud and thereby to 
1443=    security repayments at which the fraud was targeted.
1444=        So the scheme was put in place, quite simply, to 
1445=    give it the best Khans of reaping the rewards which were 
1446=    not form of the repayment.  Because the fraudsters knew 
1447=    if the transactions generally and all traced directly 
1448=    back it defaulters there was a greater Khans of the 
1449=    repayments being denied.
fmt=pb
1450=        A short point in relation to the sheer size of the 
1451=    trade.
1452=THE CHAIRMAN:  What paragraph are you on?
1453=MR KINNEAR:  Paragraph 183, sir, [SUB/60]
1454=THE CHAIRMAN:  Thank you.
1455=MR KINNEAR:  When we are looking at the amount of trade and 
1456=    better going to look later on today in more detail at 
1457=    the -- particularly the first line contra-traders, the 
1458=    amount of money in the sheer size of the trade was 
1459=    simply incredible.  Eye watering one might say, 
1460=    between April and June 2006, a relatively small group of 
1461=    companies, many with little or no history in trading and 
1462=    without much or anything in the way of capital, managed 
1463=    to turn over billions of pounds.  It was, in our 
1464=    submission, simply far too good to be true, and the 
1465=    scheme was fraudulent really from beginning to end.
1466=        The contra-trading scheme involved as we have 
1467=    already said 344 deals by Megantic, 246 of which relate 
1468=    to May and June, and they trace back to one of six 
1469=    contra-traders, again names becoming familiar to 
1470=    everyone in this room now, David Jacobs, 
1471=    Svenson Commodities, Powerstrip, Selectwelcome, Svenson 
1472=    worldwide and TCCS, and can we leave the main opening 
1473=    submission now for a period and turn to the document 
1474=    which you will find at appendix A, which deals with each 
fmt=pb
1475=    of the six contra-traders in turn.
1476=        Sir, Mr Sharp, clearly in relation to each 
1477=    contra-trader there is a huge volume of material.  There 
1478=    are lengthy and detailed witness statements and very 
1479=    voluminous exhibits to each one in relation to deals and 
1480=    other matters.  What we centre attempted at least to do 
1481=    within appendix A is to give a potted version of that 
1482=    evidence in relation to each of these six traders.  
1483=    I think in relation to each one over about five or six 
1484=    or seven pages, I'm going to take you through it and 
1485=    refer to a few of the documents.
1486=        Within this document, sir, you will see on page 1 of 
1487=    this document.  [SUB/123] you will see in relation to 
1488=    each one we lay out there that it says:
1489=        "David Jacobs, summary of the title DJ witness 
1490=    statement of Richard Davies dated 24th June and 
1491=    10th July and gone sir those are hyperlinked so if you 
1492=    ever want it find anything, if you go to this appendix 
1493=    you can find your way through to everything.
1494=        At paragraphs 1 through to 9 we have provided what 
1495=    I would call statistical information.  I'm not going to 
1496=    take you through that now because I think it is 
1497=    better -- that is material that is better that you read 
1498=    yourselves, rather than I read through it, because it is 
1499=    a series of figures, but it is designed to show you 
fmt=pb
1500=    exactly where the contra-trader fits in with Megantic in 
1501=    relation to each period, how they were crossovers, 
1502=    sometimes the contra-trader is sellinging to Megantic, 
1503=    sometimes Megantic are selling to the contra-trader, 
1504=    sometimes they are trading directly, sometimes there are 
1505=    buffers in between them and really it appears that 
1506=    within a bigger scheme they at times interchange roles.  
1507=    So one day David Jacobs will be the contra-trader and 
1508=    Megantic will be the broker, on another day David Jacobs 
1509=    will be the contra-trader and Megantic will be the 
1510=    buffer and sometimes other scenarios take place.  So I'm 
1511=    not going to go through in detail paragraphs 1 to 9 but 
1512=    I would invite you to consider those when you have some 
1513=    reading time.
1514=        Moving on then, please, to paragraph 10 and gone I'm 
1515=    not going to ask for all of the documents to be called 
1516=    up but David jaib objects was incorporated on 
1517=    2nd March 2004 and registered for VAT on 
1518=    2nd February 2005.  Just a point on that.  What you will 
1519=    see as we go through this is that in relation to first 
1520=    line contra-traders, second line contra-traders and 
1521=    indeed defaulting traders pleafn them are very new 
1522=    companies, so come 2006, April 2006, when trade has 
1523=    taken place, many of these companies have only been in 
1524=    existence for 6 to 18 months, they are in the companies 
fmt=pb
1525=    with any substantial trading history behind them.
1526=        On its application for registration the trade 
1527=    category was given as IT consultancy work and the 
1528=    estimated turnover for the next six months was 
1529=    63,000 and again there will be in virtually every case 
1530=    an enormous gap between what was being anticipated on 
1531=    the VAT return and what actually transpired.  Of course, 
1532=    there are going to be businesses which say we are going 
1533=    to turn over 50,000 and they become a great success 
1534=    within a relatively short period of time but it is the 
1535=    number of companies that that manages to happen to in 
1536=    this particular case that we say is quite simply beyond 
1537=    coincidence.
1538=        The return or the registration form was signed by 
1539=    Mohammedic balance who was then the company director and 
1540=    DJ was placed on quarterly returns.  The directorship 
1541=    later changed and time in question a man called Navigant 
1542=    I had Aslam was the director he having been appointed on 
1543=    23rd May 2005 ^sp following the resignation of the 
1544=    previous director MrIc balance and again this is 
1545=    a pattern which we often see a company will have been 
1546=    set up for one purpose or the VAT registration with the 
1547=    director there is then a change of director and very 
1548=    soon thereafter the way in which the company trades 
1549=    changes completely, and the turnover goes through the 
fmt=pb
1550=    roof.  Again, no coincidence but MrIc balance who was 
1551=    the original director of David Jacobs was at one stage 
1552=    also a director of Svenson Commodities, clearly one of 
1553=    the other contra-traders so there is already a link 
1554=    between these two companies.
1555=        DJ's VAT return for the 06/06 period which covers 
1556=    all of the transactions which are the subject of this 
1557=    appeal was received by HMRC on 31st July 2006 and we can 
1558=    see it at [279/4] please so this is the VAT return for 
1559=    the period, the quarterly period --
1560=THE CHAIRMAN:  They seem to have changed their address or 
1561=    not?  It's a Chester dpreas address gentleman you are 
1562=    quite right, sir.  Certainly there is an address at 
1563=    Regus house.  I will check that within the statements, 
1564=    you are quite right there is a different address on that 
1565=    but looking at the VAT return, sir ^ speaker) you will 
1566=    see quite simply vast sums, total value of sales and all 
1567=    other outputs excluding any VAT, just under 
1568=    393 million.  Total value of purchases, just under 
1569=    381 million.
1570=        You can see large amounts of VAT reclaimed, I think
1571=    it is just under 44 million and this is reclaimed in the 
1572=    sum of just under 4 million much this was selected for 
1573=    extended verification, and DJ were notified of this by 
1574=    way of a letter dated 1st August 2006.  They were 
fmt=pb
1575=    subsequently denied a total of 26.6 million of input tax 
1576=    credit, and an appeal was originally lodged against this 
1577=    decision but was withdrawn on 4th July 2011 and we will 
1578=    see a letter at [361/283] and the next page, please 
1579=    [361/284] it's from gately to the Tribunal service:
1580=        "We contact, and the for Steven hunt grif Ince 
1581=    insolvency practitioners and Mr Kevin held argued of 
1582=    Grant Thornton ^reads in respect of the company, the 
1583=    company is David Jacobs, we have been in correspondence 
1584=    with HM Revenue & Customs solicitor office to whom we 
1585=    dhoipped letter and write it confirm that the parties 
1586=    have agreed to the above appeal being withdrawn on the 
1587=    basis that there are no further orders as to costs."
1588=        So initially appealed, denial of input tax but the 
1589=    appeal later withdrawn by the then liquidators.
1590=        We submit that the growth of DJ's turnover was quite 
1591=    simply extraordinary.  Between its incorporation on 2 
1592=    manched 2004 ^-- correction March 2004 and 
1593=    31st March 22005 so just over one year it turned over 
1594=    the princely sum of 94.  In its second year of traitd 
1595=    trading that is the year to 31st March 2006, its 
1596=    turnover was 308 million.  In reality this was from 
1597=    13th July 2005 when the first transaction took place.
1598=        In fact I think that turnover figure may be slightly 
1599=    wrong because in the three-month period -- sorry, yes, 
fmt=pb
1600=    that is right, in the year to 31st March it is 
1601=    308 million but then in the three-month period April 
1602=    to June 2006 as we have just seen from the VAT return 
1603=    the sales are just under 393 million, so in a period of 
1604=    less than a year between 13th July 2005 # when it 
1605=    carried out its first trade and the 30th June 2006, it 
1606=    achieved turnover of over 700 million from a standing 
1607=    start.
1608=        As I already mentioned, there is a link between DJ 
1609=    and Svenson Commodities by way of a common director 
1610=    Mohammedic balance but it also had a history of trading 
1611=    with Svenson Commodities in that it had been sent 
1612=    a letter by HMRC dated 12th January 2006 informing it 
1613=    that four deals that it carried out in the 07/05 period 
1614=    had been traced to a tax loss, and Svenson Commodities 
1615=    had been their supplier in each of their deals.
1616=        They had again in our submission as with the 
1617=    appellant very clear and full knowledge of the existence 
1618=    of MTIC fraud, and if we start first of all, please, at 
1619=    [279/36] we can see a letter from the Revenue to 
1620=    David Jacobs on 29th June 2005, it is again I think we 
1621=    saw very similar letters to this yesterday.  It lays out 
1622=    the problem with MTIC fraud.  It states that requests 
1623=    for verification should be made via the Redhill office, 
1624=    it encloses Notice 726, and then states at the bottom:
fmt=pb
1625=        "If known when verifying the VAT status of new or 
1626=    potential customers suppliers information provided 
1627=    should include the following ..."
1628=        Then provides a list of items that are requested to 
1629=    be provided when any verification is being asked for.
1630=        Document at [279/22] please.  Is the first page of 
1631=    a visit report, to David Jacobs, I think the date occurs 
1632=    later but it takes place on 7th July 22005 #.
1633=MR PATCHETT-JOYCE:  Just looking at this document this is 
1634=    an example of a document where something has been 
1635=    redacted it's the VAT rrgses number, everyone knows from 
1636=    the document what is the VAT registration number is of 
1637=    David Jacobs and we have asked why some documents have 
1638=    been redacted in this form.
1639=MR KINNEAR:  There are some documents redactions reason 
1640=    them.  I haven't got to grips with every single one of 
1641=    them I have said if there are any documents that those 
1642=    representing the appellants feel very strongly about if 
1643=    they provide with us a list of those documents that have 
1644=    redaction we will revisit them.
1645=MR PATCHETT-JOYCE:  That is rather difficult with redacted 
1646=    documents because the whole purpose of a redaction is to 
1647=    blank out that is which is behind the redaction.  So 
1648=    with respect putting the burden on the party who is 
1649=    reading the redacted documents to say whether or not it 
fmt=pb
1650=    is important is to impose certainly an impractical and 
1651=    in some instances an impossible task because it F we 
1652=    knew what was behind this we wouldn't be asking.
1653=THE CHAIRMAN:  What is the -- what is behind this point?  Is 
1654=    it suggested that this isn't a visit report of a visit 
1655=    to this particular company?
1656=MR PATCHETT-JOYCE:  No, sir, I have taken this by way of 
1657=    example because this is the first will example we have 
1658=    seen of a document where there has been a redaction, in 
1659=    my submission this is a particularly good example of 
1660=    a utterly pointless redaction.  Because we do know what 
1661=    the VAT registration number is and if it were at all 
1662=    material we could substitute what has been redacted for 
1663=    the blanking out.  In this instance what is the purpose 
1664=    of the redaction?  It is completely pointless.
1665=THE CHAIRMAN:  It appears to be, yes.
1666=MR PATCHETT-JOYCE:  In other instances where there are 
1667=    several lines which have been redacted that falls into 
1668=    the other category of documents, where someone from the 
1669=    Revenue & Customs has obviously seen fit to redact 
1670=    something and because it covers several lines we don't 
1671=    know what has been redacted.  Either it is a pointless 
1672=    redaction in which case why was it done?  Or it has some 
1673=    relevance in which case we are entitled to know what the 
1674=    relevance is.
fmt=pb
1675=THE CHAIRMAN:  Yes.  In principle if you are putting in 
1676=    documents to support your case, they shouldn't be 
1677=    redacted or if they are redacted we should know why it 
1678=    has been necessary to redact them.
1679=MR PATCHETT-JOYCE:  Yes.  That is the point.
1680=THE CHAIRMAN:  That must be the basic principle.
1681=MR KINNEAR:  Yes, well there may be -- I don't know what has 
1682=    been redacted from that so I can't --
1683=THE CHAIRMAN:  It looks like the VAT registration number.
1684=MR KINNEAR:  I can't think it is because the VAT 
1685=    registration is not line above.
1686=MR PATCHETT-JOYCE:  Then if it isn't, let's find out what 
1687=    has been redacted.  I just assumed it was the VAT 
1688=    registration number.
1689=THE CHAIRMAN:  I think you should make enquiries as to why 
1690=    a redaction was made there and what is it under the 
1691=    redaction and if you are able to disclose what is under 
1692=    the redaction I think you should.
1693=MR KINNEAR:  If as we go through documents, documents arise 
1694=    we will make a list of them and we will make specific 
1695=    request in relation to those particular documents or as 
1696=    I say Mr Patchett-Joyce has other ones he wishes to 
1697=    refer to but there are thousands of documents in this 
1698=    case and there are some that are redacted and some that 
1699=    aren't --
fmt=pb
1700=THE CHAIRMAN:  I suppose the point is only really pressing 
1701=    in relation to the document that is you put before the 
1702=    Tribunal.
1703=MR KINNEAR:  Yes.
1704=THE CHAIRMAN:  I won't I'm sure and neither party will I'm 
1705=    sure refer to a very large quantity of the documents 
1706=    that are on the system and I'm sure we shall not look at 
1707=    them either.
1708=MR KINNEAR:  I will --
1709=THE CHAIRMAN:  I don't want you to --
1710=MR KINNEAR:  I will ask Mr Chapman it keep a list of these 
1711=    documents and we will make some enquiries in respect of 
1712=    them.
1713=THE CHAIRMAN:  I suppose -- I suppose the fact that there is 
1714=    a redaction here, although I maintain the criticism that 
1715=    I have made, I suppose that the fact there is 
1716=    a redaction on this particular document doesn't 
1717=    materially affect the probative value of the document.
1718=MR KINNEAR:  No, there are --
1719=THE CHAIRMAN:  But that might not be the position in 
1720=    relation to some other document.  You don't know.
1721=MR KINNEAR:  There are clearly some document which is have 
1722=    a box or several small box like this with black over 
1723=    them.  I suspect it relates to internal references and 
1724=    things like that.  There aren't any occasions as far as 
fmt=pb
1725=    I can recall -- we have already looked a at number of 
1726=    visit reports where we can see the notes of what is 
1727=    made --
1728=THE CHAIRMAN:  I suppose --
1729=MR KINNEAR:  I don't think there are any occasions where 
1730=    there are parts of the notes redacted.
1731=THE CHAIRMAN:  When knows what might be redacted or other 
1732=    documents.
1733=MR PATCHETT-JOYCE:  My learned friend refers to document 
1734=    which is tend to be visit reports, where there are 
1735=    various small box where redactions have taken place.  
1736=    That is a very interesting case in point, because what 
1737=    is being redacted in those instances is the 
1738=    Revenue & Customs internal scoring system against 
1739=    various criteria for that particular trader.
1740=        We would like to know whether that particular trader 
1741=    was scoring particularly highly, in which case --
1742=THE CHAIRMAN:  You will have to explain what a scoring 
1743=    system is.
1744=MR PATCHETT-JOYCE:  They rate the trader on various -- 
1745=    against various criteria.
1746=THE CHAIRMAN:  Reliability ^chk.
1747=MR PATCHETT-JOYCE:  For example, whether the trader has good 
1748=    document maintenance, records and things like that and 
1749=    they will grade maintenance of records on a scale 1 to 
fmt=pb
1750=    12.  I can't now remember whether 1 is good or 12 is 
1751=    good but if a trader who the Revenue & Customs have say 
1752=    visited at the end of 2005, scores particularly highly 
1753=    on that category and other category, then we would like 
1754=    to know, because that demonstrates that that trader was 
1755=    fulfilling the criteria --
1756=THE CHAIRMAN:  It demonstrates that the person when made the 
1757=    score thought that it was.
1758=MR PATCHETT-JOYCE:  It does, yes.  I am happy it accept that 
1759=    qualification.  Equally, if that company is scoring 
1760=    particularly -- in particularly low estimation, if that 
1761=    estimation is a number of months before the accounting 
1762=    period or periods in question, then again on behalf of 
1763=    Megantic I would like to know that.  Because of course
1764=    it is the Revenue & Customs who have the responsibility 
1765=    for inspection of records and detection of VAT fraud.  
1766=    If there are clear indicators against all of these 
1767=    criteria that that particular trader is not coming up to 
1768=    scratch, and the Revenue & Customs knew that months 
1769=    previously, I would certainly like to know that.  
1770=    Because that is material to the discharge by the 
1771=    Revenue & Customs of their obligations for inspection 
1772=    and detection of VAT fraud and we are told that by 
1773=    Mahageben around about paragraph 62.
1774=THE CHAIRMAN:  I am sure you will develop your submissions 
fmt=pb
1775=    as to why that is relevant to the issues that we have to 
1776=    decide.  What I assumed hitherto is that it is not our 
1777=    function to supervise in any way the conduct by the 
1778=    Revenue of their tax fraud investigation.
1779=MR PATCHETT-JOYCE:  It is not the role of the Tribunal to 
1780=    supervise the Revenue & Customs discharge of their 
1781=    functions, but, sir, if in discharging their functions 
1782=    they don't take account of, for example, indicators that 
1783=    might have been available some months previously, then 
1784=    having listened to what my learned friend has already 
1785=    said about Mobilx and I will be very interested to hear 
1786=    his legal submissions on Mobilx, then one is straight 
1787=    into the realms of the relevant responsibilities as 
1788=    between the national competent tax authority and 
1789=    individual traders for policing other traders.  And one 
1790=    is into European concepts of proportionality so that it 
1791=    does become very important in that regard sir.
1792=THE CHAIRMAN:  You will be developing that.
1793=MR KINNEAR:  I'm not saying Mr Patchett-Joyce can't have the 
1794=    document, all I am saying is if in the course of his 
1795=    preparation there are such documents as he has just 
1796=    mention which had peek his interest all he need too or 
1797=    his instructing solicitors need to is give them to us 
1798=    written down on a piece of paper.
1799=THE CHAIRMAN:  I heard your complaint on -- on-the-hoof sort 
fmt=pb
1800=    of complaint on that but a way of resolving this and 
1801=    assuming the smooth running, the appeal hearing might be 
1802=    for you to provide a list if that is possible ^chk.  For 
1803=    Mr Kinnear's clients to investigate.  I think what 
1804=    I would say regarding documents that are produced to the 
1805=    Tribunal is where they are redacted, if possible, we 
1806=    would like to see an unredacted version, if that is -- 
1807=    if you are reluctant to do that then we would like it 
1808=    hear why you are reluctant.
1809=MR KINNEAR:  If there was anything which I -- which my 
1810=    clients felt was sensitive then I would have to probably 
1811=    make some sort of ex parte PI.  Application in relation 
1812=    to it.
1813=THE CHAIRMAN:  Whatever.
1814=MR KINNEAR:  I'm not trying to preclude anybody from having 
1815=    anything I am just --
1816=THE CHAIRMAN:  As the Tribunal doesn't rule out the 
1817=    possibility that the black pencil was just carelessly 
1818=    schashed across the page.
1819=MR PATCHETT-JOYCE:  We are in danger of perhaps building 
1820=    this out of proportion on the basis of the document we 
1821=    are looking at at the present time and I seized upon 
1822=    this simply because it was the first occasion.
1823=THE CHAIRMAN:  I think you are perfectly entitled to do 
1824=    that.  Anyway that is the way --
fmt=pb
1825=MR KINNEAR:  I am sure we can resolve it.
1826=MR PATCHETT-JOYCE:  I think we can.
1827=MR KINNEAR:  In the spirit of co-operation between 
1828=    Mr Patchett-Joyce and I .
1829=MR PATCHETT-JOYCE:  I am very grateful for the indication my 
1830=    learned friend has given in relation to the discussion 
1831=    we have just had.
1832=THE CHAIRMAN:  Thank you.
1833=MR KINNEAR:  Sir, we were looking at this particular visit 
1834=    report.  Could we go to the next page, which is page 23.  
1835=    [279/23] it says:
1836=        "The main business activity intended trade in 
1837=    wholesale of mobile phones."
1838=THE CHAIRMAN:  This is David Jacobs.
1839=MR KINNEAR:  David Jacobs, yes, sir and we know it is 
1840=    registered for VAT with effect from 2nd February 2005.  
1841=    This is a visit on 7th July of 2005.
1842=THE CHAIRMAN:  One employee.
1843=MR KINNEAR:  One employee.
1844=THE CHAIRMAN:  Who was paid 200 a week.
1845=MR KINNEAR:  Paid 200 per week, date trading commenced 
1846=    further down it says 1st of the 2nd, 05, I think this is 
1847=    the application for registration, stated IT consultancy 
1848=    work MrIc balance is said to have acted as consultant.  
1849=    Not present at interview.  Any previous history in the 
fmt=pb
1850=    trade Mr Aslam said his background is in retail 
1851=    cletting, he was a director of a business called origin 
1852=    clothing of Wrexham which he stated he sold to his 
1853=    brother three months ago.  Source of start-up capital, 
1854=    circa 10,000 introducedbly Aslam from funds.  Business 
1855=    sale for set-up costs, office equipment, initial rent, 
1856=    wages, et cetera.  Principal place of business is the 
1857=    Regus and then over the page, please ^ref some further 
1858=    business days.  At the bottom, bank details, number 1, 
1859=    Barclays, in the bottom right-hand corner, number 2, 
1860=    FCIB,.
1861=THE CHAIRMAN:  Just before you get to that.  MrIc balance is 
1862=    a director of Svenson Commodities.
1863=MR KINNEAR:  He was -- at one stage he was at different 
1864=    times directors of both David Jacobs and 
1865=    Svenson Commodities, MrIc balance, yes.
1866=THE CHAIRMAN:  At different times.  Never at the same time.  
1867=    But he was also a director of a former MTIC trader.
1868=MR KINNEAR:  PC warehouseman Chester, yes.
1869=THE CHAIRMAN:  When you say MTIC trader do you mean a trader 
1870=    in mobile phones e.g. --
1871=MR KINNEAR:  It will be a -- mean wholesale trader.
1872=THE CHAIRMAN:  But my point really is will it mean more 
1873=    than -- will it mean a director of a wholesale trader in 
1874=    mobile phones which has been connected to a tax loss.
fmt=pb
1875=MR KINNEAR:  I suspect it won't mean that.  I suspect --
1876=THE CHAIRMAN:  It simply means a director of another company 
1877=    in the same trade sector.
1878=MR KINNEAR:  Yes, dealing in wholesale back-to-back 
1879=    transactions of mobile phones or CPUs.
1880=THE CHAIRMAN:  So we shouldn't -- Jew shouldn't read 
1881=    anything into that.  Page [279/25] please at the bottom 
1882=    is really the introduction to the visit.
1883=        Page [279/26] --
1884=THE CHAIRMAN:  Could you go back to the previous page.
1885=MR KINNEAR:  Page 25.
1886=THE CHAIRMAN:  So the visit was prompted by international 
1887=    marketing and management limited recently attempting to 
1888=    verify David Jacobs.
1889=MR KINNEAR:  Yes, we will see as we go along through this 
1890=    trader and lots of the defaulters and other contras that 
1891=    the officers often turn up unannounced but it is not 
1892=    a coincidence they have turned up, it is because 
1893=    something has happened, either there has been an attempt 
1894=    verify their VAT number with Redhill or on many 
1895=    occasions other officers will have visited a freight 
1896=    forwarder where they were constantly collecting 
1897=    information in relation to the transactions that are 
1898=    being carried out and they will see a new VRN number, 
1899=    a VAT registration that they haven't come across before, 
fmt=pb
1900=    trading goods and very soon thereafter they will attempt 
1901=    to make visits.  Particularly when we look at the 
1902=    defaulting traders we will see that they make a visit 
1903=    unannounced, there is nobody there and very quickly 
1904=    thereafter they issue either a regulation 25 letter 
1905=    bringing forward the VAT period, and/or 
1906=    a de-registration letter as well.
1907=THE CHAIRMAN:  So would I be right in assuming that as part 
1908=    of the task of combating fraud in this area what they 
1909=    like to do is to keep tabs on as many of these companies 
1910=    as possible by making physical visits.
1911=MR KINNEAR:  Yes.
1912=THE CHAIRMAN:  They find out one way or another that 
1913=    a particular company is trading in these goods they want 
1914=    to go and visit it to see what is going on.
1915=MR KINNEAR:  Yes, if for instance the officer teams who are 
1916=    at the freight forwarders see a new company's VRN 
1917=    no doubt they will check it on their file, thelz it is 
1918=    remember registered not to trade in mobile phones -- but 
1919=    in --
1920=THE CHAIRMAN:  It is definitely not connected with 
1921=    a particular company having made a big repayment claim?
1922=MR KINNEAR:  No.  It is a wide range of measures that they 
1923=    were using in order to fly and identify ^-- correction 
1924=    try and identify when at the could defaulting traders 
fmt=pb
1925=    and what as you will see a defaulting trader starts 
1926=    operating and very quickly, very often within a few 
1927=    weeks or even sometimes sometimes a few days the officer 
1928=    are there at the registered place of business trying to 
1929=    find them, they can't find them so they de-register them 
1930=    the fraud is so well organised as soon as that trader 
1931=    drops out there is immediately another one that is able 
1932=    to step into their shoes to keep it going but yes 
1933=    various forms of intelligence are used to try to combat 
1934=    the fraud as best --
1935=THE CHAIRMAN:  That was the point I was trying to make in my 
1936=    comments in the Else judgment, that it seemed to me that 
1937=    these schemes which one recognises are contrived are 
1938=    very, very flexible.
1939=MR KINNEAR:  Yes.
1940=THE CHAIRMAN:  Is that if a particular trader does get into 
1941=    trouble of one sort or another he can be deleted and 
1942=    another one substituted with no difficulty at all.
1943=MR KINNEAR:  "seamless ""is the word I sometimes use to 
1944=    describe it when one defaulting trader goes seamlessly 
1945=    another one is put into their place because the fraud 
1946=    must go on.
1947=THE CHAIRMAN:  Okay.  Is that a good place to stop.
1948=MR KINNEAR:  That is as good a place to stop as any sir.
1949=THE CHAIRMAN:  Thank you.  2 o'clock.
fmt=pb
1950=(1.00 pm)
1951=(The short adjournment)
1952=        Test test test test (2.00 pm)
1953=        Test test test test test pm sessionTHE CHAIRMAN:  We have had some disappointing news from the 
1954=    Competition Appeal Tribunal.  It is now unlikely that 
1955=    the court will be ready for us the week after next, but 
1956=    we can remain here for that week.
1957=        The only proviso to that being that another cases 
1958=    that running on that week may require some time for 
1959=    a video link which can only be performed in this room, 
1960=    and it might therefore be necessary for us to adjourn to 
1961=    enable that to happen but I hope that might not be more 
1962=    than an hour or two.  But 
1963=    one just has it play it by ear.
1964=        The other news is that it is not clear that we can 
1965=    use -- that a court here is going to be available for us 
1966=    for those weeks in January but we are continuing to try 
1967=    to organise some accommodation.
1968=MR KINNEAR:  Thank you very much.  Before the break, sir, we 
1969=    were looking at visit report, which is at [279/22] 
1970=    relating to a visit to David Jacobs on 7th July 2005 #, 
1971=    paragraph 16 of appendix A.
1972=        If we could go forward please to the next page 
1973=    [279/26] and we just at some of the things that were 
1974=    said at the visit.  Mr Aslam indicated that Mr Iqbal was 
fmt=pb
1975=    no longer a director he had recently resigned.  Though 
1976=    recent Company House records indicate is he still 
1977=    a director.  Mr Aslam said he had joined the company 
1978=    about six weeks ago, is he a personal prepared from of 
1979=    Mr Iqbal, Mr Aslam said he is the sole company 
1980=    shareholder, though he has not introduced any share 
1981=    capital.  He said he paid Mr Iqbal 
1982=    500 when he left.
1983=        He said they parted company due to a difference of 
1984=    opinion on how the business should develop.  Mr Aslam 
1985=    wanted to move into dealing in electronic goods, I asked 
1986=    about IT consultancy work, indicated on the VAT 1, 
1987=    Mr Aslam said Mr Iqbal was the consultant but was vague 
1988=    about this and could not say what the first return 
1989=    activities were or where the supporting records are 
1990=    possibly at an accountants but could not say who the 
1991=    accountant was.
1992=        Mr Aslam said he subscribed to the IPT dot cc 
1993=    website, and is using this plus two other sites, phone 
1994=    trade and mobile traders to research trading in 
1995=    wholesale electronic goods.
1996=        He mentioned computer monitors initially but later 
1997=    the discussion moved to mobile phones he has contacted 
1998=    a number of businesses using the databases later 
1999=    confirmed he exchanged documents with ten businesses but 
fmt=pb
2000=    has not yet verified any trader at Redhill he has spoken 
2001=    with freight forwarders but has not yet opened any 
2002=    accounts he is proposing to deal in warehouse making low 
2003=    profits per unit with payments from customers financing 
2004=    payments to suppliers.
2005=        He is also considering mortgaging his house to 
2006=    generate capital if needed.  He is not currently 
2007=    intending to deal directly with any overseas trade 
2008=    erlings.
2009=        Then further down, just skipping a paragraph, he 
2010=    said the company is not in receipt of any loans, no 
2011=    overdraft facility, no current intention for either, no 
2012=    assets apart from office equipment.  Discussed bank 
2013=    accounts, in particular the setting up of the 
2014=    First Curacao offshore account, Mr Aslam said it is not 
2015=    yet active, but has been set up because many traders he 
2016=    may deal with are using it, and it is cheaper than the 
2017=    UK account for transaction fees, the bank is listed on 
2018=    the IPT website he filled in an online application form, 
2019=    and was subsequently personally visit based 
2020=    representative/agent of the bank before it was approved.  
2021=    Details from a business card held were recorded in my 
2022=    notebook.
2023=        Then it continues, again I'm not going to read it 
2024=    all out, but over the page, please, page 279/27] just 
fmt=pb
2025=    after number 8 the officers recorded Mr Aslam appeared 
2026=    to previously have a rudimentary understanding of MTIC 
2027=    trade and VAT carousel fraud issues and referred to the 
2028=    carousel of goods under the Bond House Tribunal case.
2029=        So that is the report effectively of the visit with 
2030=    Mr Aslam the new owner of David Jacobs in the beginning 
2031=    of July 2005, and we submit that given the contents of 
2032=    this report, there is hardly a more unlikely candidate 
2033=    for a company that was going to be within a matter of 
2034=    months turning over tens, if not hundreds of millions 
2035=    of pounds per quarter.
2036=        Mr Aslam had no background in this trade.  He had no 
2037=    finance.  He had no real knowledge of what he was doing.  
2038=    Yet --
2039=THE CHAIRMAN:  Can you just help me on one thing and that is 
2040=    what -- in your submission what is it that HMRC has to 
2041=    prove in relation to the knowledge of a contra-trader.
2042=MR KINNEAR:  In order to prove the connection, we have to 
2043=    prove effectively -- we say they are all fraudulent.  
2044=    The contra-traders are acting fraudulently.  They are 
2045=    parties to the orchestrated scheme.  That they knew what 
2046=    was going on and they acted in order to further it.
2047=THE CHAIRMAN:  Do have you to go as far as to say they are 
2048=    involved in the conspiracy.
2049=MR KINNEAR:  We don't allege a conspiracy, sir, but we say 
fmt=pb
2050=    that they -- we say they are knowing partied to the 
2051=    orchestrated scheme.
2052=THE CHAIRMAN:  It wouldn't be sufficient for them just to 
2053=    have means of knowledge.
2054=MR KINNEAR:  In it wouldn't.  We accept that.  ^ no) .
2055=THE CHAIRMAN:  Has that been established by authority?
2056=MR KINNEAR:  There is certainly a fair amount of authority 
2057=    in relation to the position of the contra-trader.  
2058=    Again, we will address specifically on that at the end, 
2059=    sir.
2060=THE CHAIRMAN:  I understood that it was the case that the 
2061=    Revenue had to establish actual knowledge in the case of 
2062=    a contra-trader but I find it difficult to understand 
2063=    quite why given the approach that the European Court 
2064=    took in Kittel, regarding -- the alternative of means of 
2065=    knowledge.
2066=MR KINNEAR:  I think --
2067=THE CHAIRMAN:  But the position is agreed between 
2068=    the parties.
2069=MR PATCHETT-JOYCE:  Sir if I can interject and off the top 
2070=    of my head, I think that the answer to your point -- 
2071=    your point it correct, that there has to be actual 
2072=    knowledge on the part of the contra-trader.  I think 
2073=    that that position is made clear at least through 
2074=    necessary implication in the judgment of 
fmt=pb
2075=    Mr Justice Lewison as he then was in the 
2076=    Chancery Division appeal in Livewire.
2077=MR KINNEAR:  Yes, I think that is right.  I think the 
2078=    Chancellor also dealt with it in Blue Sphere as well.
2079=THE CHAIRMAN:  I think I he did as well.
2080=MR PATCHETT-JOYCE:  I should have had a better recollection 
2081=    of that than of Livewire as I appeared.  I made the 
2082=    submissions before the Chancellor in Blue Sphere.
2083=MR KINNEAR:  I think it is part of his judgment in 
2084=    Blue Sphere.  I think.
2085=THE CHAIRMAN:  I thought and I may be wrong here but 
2086=    I thought Chancellor in Blue Sphere had actually said 
2087=    there needed to be -- that a conspiracy needed to be 
2088=    established of which the contra-trader was a member or 
2089=    party.
2090=MR PATCHETT-JOYCE:  I think you are right and I think it is 
2091=    probably round ^ brownd paragraphs 52/53 of the 
2092=    judgment.
2093=THE CHAIRMAN:  You are the sort of person who can remember 
2094=    the page numbers of Law Reports, I see that.
2095=MR PATCHETT-JOYCE:  I have had a certain amount of time to 
2096=    commit some of this to memory.
2097=THE CHAIRMAN:  As I say, I don't myself -- not having spent 
2098=    a lot of time thinking but about it but I don't myself 
2099=    see where there should be a different test in relation 
fmt=pb
2100=    to contra-traders as there is from the trader that is 
2101=    the knelt these appeals, but I note that that is 
2102=    the agreed position.  The position as agreed between 
2103=    the parties.
2104=MR KINNEAR:  Yes.  I'm just opening the Blue Sphere judgment 
2105=    more to see whether Mr Patchett-Joyce's memory is as 
2106=    good as we all thinks it.  I'm hoping to find there 
2107=    isn't actually a paragraph 52/53.
2108=THE CHAIRMAN:  I never had you down as mischievous 
2109=    Mr Kinnear.
2110=MR KINNEAR:  I think is he right.  He is right.
2111=THE CHAIRMAN:  Anyway we will come to that I'm sure.
2112=MR KINNEAR:  If we can come back to that, sir.
2113=THE CHAIRMAN:  Your point, this visit report is presumably 
2114=    evidence that you rely on it show actual knowledge on 
2115=    the part of DJ.
2116=MR KINNEAR:  Yes, what we --
2117=THE CHAIRMAN:  David Jacobs.
2118=MR KINNEAR:  What we say is when we have looked at all 
2119=    siskts first line contra-traders and indeed the second 
2120=    line contra-traders there is a pattern emerges.  They 
2121=    are effectively entities of men of straw with little or 
2122=    no background in this particular trade.  They have no 
2123=    finance or capital, they have no employees, they have no 
2124=    experience, yet within very short period of time they 
fmt=pb
2125=    are turning over fan it's aic sums of money.
2126=THE CHAIRMAN:  So you say that is the inference a we ought 
2127=    to drew from that evidence.
2128=MR KINNEAR:  Yes.
2129=THE CHAIRMAN:  Is actual knowledge.
2130=MR KINNEAR:  Yes and by virtue of where -- the pattern of 
2131=    their trade as much as anything else, the way in which 
2132=    they conduct their trades but again there is a section 
2133=    in the opening submissions I will come to pulling 
2134=    together all of that information when we have looked at 
2135=    each of these individual entities.
2136=        Over the page at [279/27] I have dealt with the 
2137=    rudimentary understanding I think I dealt with with that 
2138=    already so that is a summary of that particular visit.
2139=        If we turn forward, please, to [279/38] this is the 
2140=    first page of further VAT audit report, if we go 
2141=    forward, please, in fact to [279/43] the officer has 
2142=    recorded not only the visit but some telephone calls 
2143=    which preceded it.  If we see on 13th July 22007 the 
2144=    officer records:
2145=        "IPhoneed Mr Aslam, he said he had completed his 
2146=    first deal yesterday and has faxed documents I later 
2147=    attended queens dock office ... Redhill verification on 
2148=    recycled for you and a purchase order from 
2149=    network euro."
fmt=pb
2150=        So effectively Mr Aslam was stating that he has got 
2151=    his first deal, he's going to buy from recycled for you 
2152=    and he's going to sell to network euro.  Then the next 
2153=    day, 14th July --
2154=THE CHAIRMAN:  In the reference to -- in the paragraph you 
2155=    have just referred to, I asked if David Jacobs number is 
2156=    still blocked, what does that mean.
2157=MR KINNEAR:  I think on occasions the Revenue put a stop on 
2158=    a VAT number being used.  For instance, if they came 
2159=    into -- if they had information which suggested a trader 
2160=    was about to carry out deals without the trader having 
2161=    contacted them first of all, I think what they would do 
2162=    is block the number.  And also there was no evidence to 
2163=    begin with of any intention to trade, so although a VRN 
2164=    number had been provided it had been blocked until they 
2165=    provided that information that showed they were --
2166=THE CHAIRMAN:  What does it mean to block a number?
2167=MR KINNEAR:  It just means it won't be cleared by Redhill.
2168=THE CHAIRMAN:  It won't be cleared by Redhill but it is 
2169=    still a valid VAT number.
2170=MR KINNEAR:  I believe so, yes.
2171=THE CHAIRMAN:  They can still issue VAT invoices.
2172=MR KINNEAR:  Yes.  14th July is a visit to the place of 
2173=    business and in the second paragraph under that date it 
2174=    says:
fmt=pb
2175=        "Discussed how the first deal came about the deal 
2176=    was 500 send OS30 phones said he found their website 
2177=    from a web search for recycle.  At the time he was 
2178=    seeking recycled stock in working condition, this may 
2179=    still happen at a future date he knows a firm in 
2180=    Manchester who could we furnish phones order Mr Aslam 
2181=    said he contacted recycled for you by phone and was 
2182=    offered various models of new stock including the send 
2183=    owe phones at a specified price with a limited offer to 
2184=    buy this was on 12th July, contacted recycle for you as 
2185=    peat not sure of surname thinks he's a director never 
2186=    personally met him but intends to arrange a meeting in 
2187=    the future never visited principal place of business 
2188=    never saw the goods nor arranged for inspection of the 
2189=    goods in which he dealt."
2190=        Skipping a paragraph:
2191=        "I asked about payments in and out, Mr Aslam said he 
2192=    had agreed a short period of credit with the supplier 
2193=    a few days nothing in writing, also network euro has 
2194=    asked for similar credit which Mr Aslam reluctantly 
2195=    agreed to."
2196=THE CHAIRMAN:  Network euro being ...
2197=MR KINNEAR:  The customer.  So he has received credit from 
2198=    his supplier, and is giving credit to network euro.:
2199=        "No payments in or out had been plead Aslam said he 
fmt=pb
2200=    would pay recycled for you directly no third party 
2201=    payments."
2202=        Going down to the next paragraph:
2203=        "Asked about dealings with network euro Mr Aslam 
2204=    said he offered the stock on the IPT website, and 
2205=    shortly after received phone calls from prospective 
2206=    buyers one of which was network euro."
2207=        And there is then additional detail.
2208=        There was a further visit arranged originally for 
2209=    11th August 2005 but it was cancelled by Mr Aslam who 
2210=    stated he was business doing due diligence checks but 
2211=    there was a further visit ^ busy) then on 
2212=    19th October 2005 and the visit report is at [279/45] 
2213=    and if we go down, please, to page [279/50] you will see 
2214=    the date of the 19th October, about five paragraphs 
2215=    down:
2216=        "States attend the principal place of business 
2217=    accompanied by another officer Mr Aslam confirmed is he 
2218=    the sole director and company secretary is now his 
2219=    employee sar pass from Hussein all deals conducted or 
2220=    approved by Mr Aslam alone no employees in the company 
2221=    an auditor has not yet been appointed."
2222=        Next paragraph:
2223=        "Company bank accounts remain as per last visit, 
2224=    Barclays and FCIB, all MTIC deals are conducted through 
fmt=pb
2225=    the FCIB account all deals to date are new mobile phones 
2226=    is considering dealing in computer goods no firm 
2227=    intention at present."
2228=        There is then some discussion about freight 
2229=    forwarders but can we go forward, please, to [279/51] 
2230=    and it is the third main paragraph down:
2231=        "I asked if Mr Aslam has examined the geedz intend 
2232=    to trade no was the answer he verbally requested ASR 
2233=    dwroad check the goods but has not received a response 
2234=    no ID on pricing structure or different types of 
2235=    inspections available asked if he has completed or 
2236=    intends an IMEI inspection his response was not at the 
2237=    time I asked the question.  But after asking how would 
2238=    he know the goods were as described or were not stolen 
2239=    or counterfaight answer being he would not know Mr Aslam 
2240=    intends to instruct full IMEI inspection from ASR before 
2241=    completing the deal.  Informed him he should request 
2242=    full IMEI report to be sent to him and retained as part 
2243=    of his records informed him it should be considered 
2244=    complete IMEI inspections on all deals in future as part 
2245=    of his normal checks.  Discussed due diligence checks 
2246=    generally.  Mr Aslam exchanges detail and verifies at 
2247=    Redhill prior to deals with new traders and indicated he 
2248=    had only conducted visits to places of business on a few 
2249=    of those traders.  There are no indications the company 
fmt=pb
2250=    has ever conducted any other background checks, no 
2251=    Companies House searches or filing history obtain nod 
2252=    checks with credit reference agencies no trade reference 
2253=    no, sir identity checks Mr Aslam said he has phoned 
2254=    other established traders to ask about potential new 
2255=    clients but has not retained any records of this in the 
2256=    files produced.  Reminded Mr Aslam again of the need to 
2257=    conduct a satisfactory level of checks referred him to 
2258=    Notice 726 ..."
2259=        Et cetera, et cetera.  So again all these matters 
2260=    being drawn fully to his attention.
2261=        By way of a letter dated 12th January 2006 I am 
2262=    afraid I haven't included in the reference in the 
2263=    document.
2264=THE CHAIRMAN:  Do you have it?
2265=MR KINNEAR:  I shouldn't able to find it relatively easily.  
2266=    ^-- correction I should be able to find relatively 
2267=    easily.  (Pause).  [279/30] please.
2268=THE CHAIRMAN:  Thank you.
2269=MR KINNEAR:  So again letter to David Jacobs generic --
2270=THE CHAIRMAN:  That is 4 out of 4.
2271=MR KINNEAR:  Yes, writing to you as a result of enquiries 
2272=    your transactions we note of four transaction examined 
2273=    four commenced with defaulting traders, resulting in the 
2274=    loss to the Revenue and then over the page, please 
fmt=pb
2275=    [279/31] the four of them are listed, so we can see the 
2276=    name of the customer buying from David Jacobs is 
2277=    Svenson Commodities and further information in relation 
2278=    to Notice 726 and other provisions provided.
2279=        An overview thefnt trade which it carried out in the 
2280=    06/06 period which is the most relevant period to this 
2281=    appeal.  During that period it carried out a total of 
2282=    315 deals to a value of approximately 393 million, 295 
2283=    deals involved mobile phones, and the remaining 20 were 
2284=    trades in CPUs.  Sir, just when I deal with paragraph 23 
2285=    I think it would be useful to have available the diagram 
2286=    at appendix D, the one with the coloured arrows on it.  
2287=    It's on the screen now as well.
2288=        So David Jacobs carried out three distinct types of 
2289=    deals, 137 deals were DJ purchased from a UK-based 
2290=    trader and sold to an EU-based trader i.e. it acted as 
2291=    a broker.  In 97 of those 137 deals were traced directly 
2292=    back to a defaulting trader, so that would be the yellow 
2293=    line, sir.  So EU trader defaulter buffer David Jacobs 
2294=    EU trader.  That is the yellow line.
2295=        40 deals did not trace directly to a defaulter but 
2296=    rather to one of 8 second line contra-traders and 
2297=    thereby to a tax loss.  That, sir, would be depicted by 
2298=    the blue line.
2299=THE CHAIRMAN:  Yes.
fmt=pb
2300=MR KINNEAR:  If it had been left --
2301=MR PATCHETT-JOYCE:  And the red line.
2302=MR KINNEAR:  And the red line but I am talking specifically 
2303=    about David Jacobs.  David Jacobs' particular deals so 
2304=    these are the two types of deals in the -- 137 deals 
2305=    with a purchase from the UK and sell to the EU, they are 
2306=    split into two types, some that trace directly back to 
2307=    a defaulter, and others that trace 40 of them that trace 
2308=    back to a defaulter via a second line contraso as 
2309=    Mr Patchett-Joyce points out you have to go to the red 
2310=    line to see that.
2311=        Those 137 deals had a total value of just over 
2312=    164 million and in relation to those deals, they would 
2313=    have been in a large repayment position.  So they would 
2314=    have been -- would've had a claim to a large sum of 
2315=    input tax to be repaid to them.
2316=        In the second category, so that is really one 
2317=    category which splits into two subcategories.  Second 
2318=    category, 92 deals were David Jacobs purchased from 
2319=    an EU-based supplier in this case Mighty Mobile, 
2320=    Adobcom, Mountainrix, Paul Pol Comm and Starlet and sold 
2321=    to a UK-based customer i.e. David Jacobs acted as the 
2322=    acquirer and these particular transactions are depicted 
2323=    by the green line on the diagram.  These effectively are 
2324=    the contra-trades with the goods eventually being 
fmt=pb
2325=    dispatched back to the EU and on the diagram we can see 
2326=    Megantic named there and Megantic acted as the broker in 
2327=    36 of these deals and as the buffer in a further three.
2328=        If we look at some other slightly more detailed 
2329=    diagrams.  If we go, please, to [361/119] so we have at 
2330=    the top of the page the European suppliers, that I just 
2331=    mentioned Starlet, Mighty Mobile, et cetera, who all 
2332=    sell to David Jacobs, David Jacobs then sells to --
2333=THE CHAIRMAN:  Is Megantic in in in these chains buffer.
2334=MR KINNEAR:  It is both, sir.
2335=THE CHAIRMAN:  I see.  When it's green it is a broker when 
2336=    it's blue it's a buffer.
2337=MR KINNEAR:  That's correct.  So we see David Jacobs and 
2338=    then we see the companies acting as buffers including 
2339=    Megantic, Evenmore which I mentioned yesterday, 
2340=    Regent Commodities which we will hear more about.
2341=THE CHAIRMAN:  Is there a chain here that goes David Jacobs 
2342=    Megantic wild intery Megantic or not.
2343=MR KINNEAR:  No what this is showing it's an overview, sir.  
2344=    So it is showing David Jacobs have five suppliers, they 
2345=    then sell to one of 11 different companies.
2346=THE CHAIRMAN:  This is not illustrating any particular 
2347=    deals.
2348=MR KINNEAR:  It is not illustrating any particular deal.  
2349=    And those 11 buffers then sell in turn to 8 different 
fmt=pb
2350=    brokers including Megantic, Regent, Powerstrip who then 
2351=    sell to the list of European companies which we see at 
2352=    the bottom which includes, if we look down the list, 
2353=    Adobcom, and Pol Comm who are two of the companies who 
2354=    were at the beginning of the chain.  Of course this 
2355=    diagram is not attempting to show a carousel from 
2356=    Adobcom back down Adobcom but simply an overview of all 
2357=    of the companies that were involved in this particular 
2358=    section of trade.  This relates to April 2006, if we go, 
2359=    please, to [361/121] we will see a similar diagram for 
2360=    the May deals similar EU companies at the top, a number 
2361=    of the same buffer companies, again this time we see 
2362=    going from the left-hand side TCCS, Svenson Commodities, 
2363=    on the far right ^ right-hand side Megantic and selling 
2364=    to ten break broker traders including Megantic, 
2365=    Svenson Commodities who in turn stole that group of 
2366=    European companies which again includes Pol Comm at the 
2367=    bottom.
2368=        Then finally, please, [361/123] June deals, not as 
2369=    many companies involved but again similar pattern, 
2370=    purchasing from the EU going through a buffer, then 
2371=    a broker and back to the EU again.  So, sir, it's 
2372=    effectively -- these diagrams are effectively designed 
2373=    to try and build-up a picture of the trades so we have 
2374=    our appendix D as our highest overview, our macro-view 
fmt=pb
2375=    of the whole scheme.  These diagrams now are bring us 
2376=    down another level and when we get to look at our 
2377=    schedule E, that is bring it down to the most microlevel 
2378=    showing us on a transaction-by-transaction basis.
2379=        So in relation to those particular deals they total 
2380=    to just over 129 million, and so because of the type of 
2381=    transactions they were, substantially reduced the 
2382=    repayment position that David Jacobs would have found 
2383=    itself in if they had not been carried out and shifted 
2384=    in this case the repayment claimed to the brokers such 
2385=    as Megantic.
2386=        The third type of deal which David Jacobs carried 
2387=    out then, they are not depicted on appendix D but they 
2388=    also carried out 86 UK-to-UK buffer deals but we have no 
2389=    detailed information in relation to David Jacobs in 
2390=    relation to those particular deals.
2391=        The effect of the three types of deals but in 
2392=    particular the acquisitions and the dispatches was that 
2393=    there was effectively an offsetting position and on 
2394=    a turnover of almost 400 million, the net reclaim -- the 
2395=    net claim was for a repayment of just under 4 million.
2396=        In 97 of the broker deals that led directly to tax 
2397=    losses, David Jacobs had 14 suppliers and 1 # # 1 
2398=    customers.  And there are nine different missing traders 
2399=    at the beginning of the chains, Birdwood, Bullfinch, 
fmt=pb
2400=    Mohammed Ali, Midwest, Prompt Info, Restar, Stockmart 
2401=    West One and excess enterprise the tax loss on those 97 
2402=    deals is a shade over 15.5 million.
2403=        So that is the first portion of the 1 # 37 deals, 97 
2404=    tracing to direct tax loss.  In the remaining 40 deals 
2405=    where David Jacobs exported the acquiring 
2406=    importer -- the acquiring or importing trader was one of 
2407=    8 traders each of which was involved in a second set of 
2408=    offsetting transactions which led to a defaulting 
2409=    trader, effectively the second line contra-traders plus 
2410=    some of the first line contra-traders.  So if you look, 
2411=    sir, at paragraph 26 in this section of the submission 
2412=    ^ref you will see the 8 second line contras were 
2413=    385 North, Digikom, Powerstrip, Export Tech, Pan Euro
2414=    Ventures select and Svenson Commodities and TCCS, so 
2415=    Powerstrip, select, vent come and TCCS ^sp are first 
2416=    line contra-traders in their own right but they also 
2417=    act, if we again look at appendix D, also in that box 
2418=    which is marked second line contras so they pop up in 
2419=    different positions.
2420=        The June deals are summarised in a diagram which we 
2421=    will find at [361/125] this, sir, now is a summary 
2422=    effectively depicting the blue line.  So we have the EU 
2423=    suppliers at the top, we have the second line contras 
2424=    who either sell directly to David Jacobs in the case of 
fmt=pb
2425=    Pan Euro and 385 North, or through a number of buffers 
2426=    in the case of TCCS, Selectwelcome, Digikom and 
2427=    Export Tech.  And all of those goods then exported by 
2428=    David Jacobs back out of the UK.
2429=        One of the points to pick up, sir, is that when 
2430=    David Jacobs purchased from the EU, they always sold to 
2431=    the UK.  When they purchased from the UK, they 
2432=    invariably sold to the EU.  They are of course buffer 
2433=    transactions but they never acted in the position of 
2434=    purchasing from the EU and selling to the EU.  So there 
2435=    was always at least two traders in between the EU 
2436=    trader, two UK traders between the EU trader at the top 
2437=    of the chain and the EU trader at the bottom of the 
2438=    chain.  Reason for that we submit is quite simple: if 
2439=    David Jacobs had been purchasing from the EU that 
2440=    purchase would have been zero rated, and if they had 
2441=    been selling in the same transaction to the EU, that 
2442=    would also have been zero rated so there would have been 
2443=    no liability to -- there would have been a liability to 
2444=    account on the VAT return but there would in effect have 
2445=    been no VAT to pay on the transactions and of course if 
2446=    that had been the case it would not have enabled the 
2447=    fraud to work.
2448=        So that is why every time we look at this we see at 
2449=    least two UK traders sandwiched in between the EU ones.
fmt=pb
2450=        David Jacobs invoices if we can pull up an example, 
2451=    please, at [279/251] this is a typical David Jacobs 
2452=    invoice, the actual detail and detail at the moment for 
2453=    these purposes doesn't matter but at the bottom you will 
2454=    see it says really the only contractual terms that on it 
2455=    says:
2456=        "Title of the all goods supplied shall remain with 
2457=    David Jacobs UK limited until payment has been received 
2458=    in full."
2459=        In general, David Jacobs shipped the goods from the 
2460=    UK to the EU before it had received payment from its EU 
2461=    customer, and regularly shipped to a country other than 
2462=    the one where the EU customer was said to be based.  All 
2463=    of its transactions were effectively back-to-back, 
2464=    buying and selling the same amounts.  They didn't on the 
2465=    face of it make a loss on any of the deals, all their 
2466=    suppliers and customers used the FCIB bank.  The pattern 
2467=    of profits was similar that found with Megantic and the 
2468=    other contra-traders transactions, that is small 
2469=    mark-ups or very small mark-ups in the buffer 
2470=    transactions, but much, much larger profits or markups 
2471=    in the exporter transactions.
2472=        They have never produced any due diligence material, 
2473=    despite a number of requests and I didn't go to that 
2474=    paragraph but there are a number of letters where 
fmt=pb
2475=    due diligence material was requested.  None was ever 
2476=    supplied, and this is despite the apparent appointment 
2477=    of someone who was -- it seems was really appointed to 
2478=    oversee due diligence.  If we look, please, at 
2479=    [281/318]:
2480=        "Dear rich order ..."
2481=        Who the officer:
2482=        "... please accept this letter to inform as youd to 
2483=    the various roles of employees in the company,

2486=    selling of stock sar Hussein company secretary roles and

2494=    I have made a deal, other responsibilities involve the 
2495=    handling of with my full authority paperwork needed by 
2496=    HMRC in deals both in the UK and overseas also cef sin 
2497=    authorised by myself to discuss any issues raised by 
2498=    HMRC himself whenever needed."
2499=        Assume man not employed by David Jacobs UK 
fmt=pb
2500=    self-supplied contractor carrying out back keeping so it 
2501=    was this very small team of people that had managed to 
2502=    achieve a turnover of 400 million in just three months 
2503=    of trading.
2504=        We submit as we do with each of these contra-traders 
2505=    that the only inference a can be drawn from the evidence 
2506=    is that David Jacobs was conducting cannot trieferred 
2507=    and fraudulent trade in further a much larger 
2508=    orchestrated scheme to cheat the Revenue.
2509=        The next contra-trader is Digital Satellite 2000 or 
2510=    Powerstrip.  Again, at paragraphs 1 through to 9 we lay 
2511=    out in considerable detail, including -- I didn't 
2512=    mention on the last occasion -- in the footnotes we lay 
2513=    out the actual IDN numbers that we are referring to in 
2514=    each of the statistics.  So if you wish when you are 
2515=    reading this you can refer across to schedule E and see 
2516=    the particular transactions that we are referring to.
2517=        Digital Satellite Powerstrip was incorporated on 
2518=    20th September 2000 and registered for VAT on 
2519=    6th August 2001.  Perhaps not surprising given its name, 
2520=    or the company name, its business activity was state as 
2521=    being installation and design of satellite systems with 
2522=    an estimated turnover in the next twelve months of 
2523=    100,000.  From the date of incorporation until 
2524=    21st March 2006 the director who held 99 per cent of the 
fmt=pb
2525=    shares was Mohammed use evidence.  He was replaced as 
2526=    director on that date by use mar hack ^sp but he 
2527=    continued to hold the shares and Mr Hack was the 
2528=    director of the company until it went into liquidation 
2529=    on 19th April 2007.
2530=        The company secretary was that herruous satisfy and 
2531=    the principal place of business were April 2 240U6Z was 
2532=    the empress business centre, 380 Chester road.  And 
2533=    until October 2005 the trading activity was in fact the 
2534=    design and installation of satellite systems from that 
2535=    time onwards, Powerstrip's trade involved the wholesale 
2536=    of mobile phones, CPUs and some other electrical items 
2537=    and at paragraph 13 we have laid out what we would 
2538=    describe is a phenomenal, meteoric increase in its 
2539=    growth of its annual turnover so year ending 31st July 
2540=    it 2003, 75,000, 2004, 81,000, 2005, 37,000, 2006, 
2541=    604 million.
2542=        Sales in the quarter alone 06/06 amounted to 
2543=    3,607,000,000, and as we have just looked ^-- 
2544=    correction 367 million --
2545=THE CHAIRMAN:  Was this company on the three months --
2546=MR KINNEAR:  Three month stagger sir.  In general I think -- 
2547=    certainly in general but I think in relation to all of 
2548=    the contra-traders are by and large on quarterly 
2549=    staggers.
fmt=pb
2550=        So again three types of deals.  311 deals in the 
2551=    06/06 period, 10 # 4 acquisition deals where Powerstrip 
2552=    purchased from the EU and sold to UK-based customers and 
2553=    again we can see this depicted in three diagrams.  First 
2554=    of all, [361/127] again, sir, a similar diagram to that 
2555=    we saw in relation to David Jacobs.  You will see it is 
2556=    by and large the same European suppliers.  It is very 
2557=    much the same group of buffer companies, and it is 
2558=    certainly a considerable overlap in the broker traders 
2559=    and indeed in the EU companies to whom the goods were 
2560=    eventually sold.  So they are not exact mirrors on each 
2561=    occasion but you will be able to see when you look at 
2562=    these diagrams there is a huge overlap between those 
2563=    from whom each the contra-traders is buying from whom 
2564=    they are selling, whom they are selling, to who is doing 
2565=    the exporting from the UK and who is purchasing on the 
2566=    face of the documents in the EU.  So a great deal of 
2567=    overlap.
2568=        The next diagram for May is at [361/129] and we see 
2569=    very familiar names at the top, Starlet, Adobcom, 
2570=    Mighty Mobile, Pol Comm.  Again, in the buffers, 
2571=    Megantic, Svenson Commodities, Regent, Evenmore who 
2572=    I mentioned before, brokers Evenmore, Megantic, 
2573=    Svenson Commodities, and EU companies, Cayenne we are 
2574=    seeing time and time again, Ascomp, Planetmania BRD all 
fmt=pb
2575=    of these companies we will see later on most of them in 
2576=    any event are all customers of Megantic at one time or 
2577=    another.
2578=        I think I have already said it but we will see as we 
2579=    go through that people take different positions.  
2580=    Sometimes Megantic are the broker sometimes they are the 
2581=    buffer.  Sometimes Powerstrip are the acquirer, 
2582=    sometimes they are the broker.  They really take 
2583=    different positions.
2584=        The next diagram for June, [361/131] please.  
2585=    In June we are seeing that there are really only two 
2586=    European suppliers in June, Adobcom and Mighty Mobile.  
2587=    Again, to Powerstrip, six break erls including Regent -- 
2588=    buffers including Regent and then two brokers Megantic 
2589=    and Base Interactive and we can see more easily on this 
2590=    diagram because they are fewer but the arrows leading 
2591=    from Megantic showing they in fact made sales to each of 
2592=    those European customers.
2593=        So those are the acquisition deals.  Depicted on the 
2594=    appendix D again by the green line.  Powerstrip like 
2595=    David Jacobs also carried out buffer deals i.e. UK-to-UK 
2596=    deals.  58 of them but in the case of Powerstrip unlike 
2597=    David Jacobs I think there appears to have been an 
2598=    extend verification exercise into those as well.  And 
2599=    every single one of their buffer deals has been traced 
fmt=pb
2600=    back to a defaulting trader.  Again, the names are laid 
2601=    out there, they are familiar names to you I am sure 
2602=    already.  Many of them.
2603=        Then finally their third type of deals, 149 broker 
2604=    deals where Powerstrip purchased from UK-based suppliers 
2605=    and sold to EU-based customers.  77 of the transactions 
2606=    have been traced back directly to defaulting traders so

2625=    the output tax payable on the acquisition deals largely 
2626=    balanced each other out and on the 06/06 return

2703=    see that the margins, the last two columns state margin 
2704=    and mark jawps we can see that the margins are measured 
2705=    from around about 4 per unit up to I think the greatest 
2706=    one is 27 per unit and percentage mark-up on the 
2707=    right-hand side ranges from just under 5 per cent to 
2708=    just over 6 per cent.  So ^-- correction just over 
2709=    7 per cent, so those are the mark-ups and the margins 
2710=    being made on the export deals.
2711=        Below that, if we just look at the columns below we 
2712=    will see who they are selling to.  We see the mark-ups

2714=    Maximum of 1.25 and measured in percentage terms in no 
2715=    more than half a per cent mark-up.  If we scroll across

2717=    relation to those particular deals, they are sales to 
2718=    UK-based companies, again including companies we are 
2719=    already very familiar with TCCS, David Jacobs,

2850=        The turnover of Select between 2001 and 2005 when it 
2851=    was obviously operating as a retail store of some sort

2853=    period when Select commenced trading in mobile phones 
2854=    the turnover was in excess of 8 million, when they acted 
2855=    originally as a buffer in mobile phone transactions.  In 
2856=    the 06/06 period as I have said it increased to 
2857=    an incredible 224 million.
2858=        They had ceased trading by 30th September 2006, and 
2859=    the explosion in turnover is really the same, the same 
2860=    pattern as seen in relation to all of the other

2862=        The breakdown of their return of the 224 million

2869=    goods directly from Fyffe suppliers based in another EU 
2870=    country and sold them to UK-based traders.  That would 
2871=    be the green line again on the appendix D and if we 
2872=    look, please, at [318/183] we will see a summary of

2874=    summary of their acquisitions and we can see the similar 
fmt=pb
2875=    companies Forex BRD Adobcom Mighty Mobile 
2876=    Pol Commingling who we have seen, they are virtually 
2877=    ubiquitous to these contra-traders in this case it has 
2878=    been traced back another step further to Parasail and 
2879=    Comica more of them later, similar group of buffer 
2880=    traders, even more ^-- correction Evenmore, white

2884=    Planetmania Cayenne Intangible, Senbetel, Adobcom, all 
2885=    the same ones and again another diagram for June.  
2886=    Please, at [361/133] again very similar pattern, June as 
2887=    we have seen with the other traders, the only two EU 
2888=    suppliers in June are Adobcom and Mighty Mobile.  
2889=    Tracing back to Parasail, Forex and Comica, we will fine 
2890=    ^ find out later on those three companies all apparently 
2891=    linked to each other.  A large group of buffers, von 
2892=    come, Powerstrip, Wildberry, David Jacobs, Megantic,

2894=    traders again Megantic, David Jacobs, Powerstrip, and 
2895=    again similar EU customers.

2897=    which were valued in the 06/06 period at just over 
2898=    83 million.  The input tax credit claimed by the nine 
2899=    brokers in relation to the 73 deals was just shy of

2904=    deals, 48 of them have been traced back to one of ten 
2905=    defaulting traders and again this is at paragraph 14B, 
2906=    you will see familiar names Bullfinch, 3D Animations, XS 
2907=    Enterprises and a tax loss in those transactions of just 
2908=    over 9 million.  Finally their third group of 
2909=    transactions, 66 deals where they act as the acquirer.  
2910=    So this is shown by the -- sorry, where they act as the 
2911=    exporter, 66 deals, where they purchase from the UK, and 
2912=    then sell to one of five EU customers.  Depicted in the 
2913=    yellow, -- by the yellow line on appendix D.  These are 
2914=    broker deals to a value of just over 84 million, of the 
2915=    66 deals, 65 have been traced back to one of six

2956=    visit on 3rd April 2007, visit to their office, visit 
2957=    made at 10 Princess way with Mr amad the landlord let us 
2958=    in the premise because no rent had been paid and the

2976=    is that they originally appealed that -- sorry, they

2980=    17th March 2009 with a VAT liability to HMRC in excess 
2981=    of 12 million.  So this company and indeed many of the 
2982=    others, although they are -- we term them contra-traders 
2983=    they are effectively missing traders as well because 
2984=    they have disappeared and can't be traced down without 
2985=    providing any of their trading documentation.
2986=        The next one, sir, is Svenson Commodities, moving on

3041=    covering all the previous deals.
3042=        Svenson Commodities is the one slight exception 
3043=    amongst the contra-traders, it has something of 
3044=    a slightly longer history than the others.  Dating back 
3045=    about two to two and a half years from the date that we 
3046=    are concerned with in our appeal.  So this is activity 
3047=    in January 2004.

3054=        Then down below he is asked whether the company

3077=        There is then a discussion about the records they 
3078=    keep in the next paragraph, and then Mr Koser was asked 
3079=    if he had opened any new bank accounts:
3080=        "He stated a Curacao account had been opened 
3081=    in March 2005."

3112=    letters noiching them notifying them of tax losses in 
3113=    their chains.  [375/30] please this is effectively

3125=        Within the statement there is also detailed -- 
3126=    I don't plan to go to each one, but perhaps if we just 
3127=    bring up, please, a page from Mr Williams statements 
3128=    which at [368/143]
3129=MR PATCHETT-JOYCE:  This is of course subject to any points 
3130=    we raise about the witness statements.
3131=MR KINNEAR:  Are there points in relation to him.
3132=MR PATCHETT-JOYCE:  Yes as to whether -- Mr Williams is 
3133=    in -- the point sir Mr Williams is in substitution of 
3134=    Mr How will Owen and ^-- correction Hywel Owen andure 
3135=    view as it presently stands is that the order for 
3136=    Mr Williams evidence was to be in substitution, Mr owe 
3137=    benefit has retired and he was to step into Mr Owen's 
3138=    shoes.
3139=        Our understanding, however, is that Mr Williams has 
3140=    gone very substantially beyond simply stepping into 
3141=    Mr Owen's shoes, and that relates to the 2012 evidence 
3142=    which I have already flagged up with my learned friend 
3143=    and was part of the housekeeping that we dealt with 
3144=    yesterday morning.  So anythings which shown from 
3145=    Mr Williams statement can be -- I don't want to 
3146=    interrupt my learned friend more than is necessary to 
3147=    put a marker down, but obviously anything which is said 
3148=    to the Tribunal would have to be on a de bene esse 
3149=    basis.
fmt=pb
3150=MR KINNEAR:  I will go one better than that and we will skip 
3151=    it --
3152=THE CHAIRMAN:  I recall this was one of the matters raised 
3153=    at the interlocutory hearing and I thought the parties 
3154=    had agreed to sort it out between them.
3155=MR PATCHETT-JOYCE:  We have a bit more sorting out to do.
3156=THE CHAIRMAN:  I see.  Very well.  We will move on.
3157=MR KINNEAR:  I will move on for now, sir.
3158=MR PATCHETT-JOYCE:  I am obliged.
3159=MR KINNEAR:  The growth of the Svenson Commodities turnover 
3160=    again was extraordinary, year ending 31st March, 
3161=    approximately 7.5 million.  Year ending 31st March 2005, 
3162=    39 million.  Year ending 31st March 2006, approximately 
3163=    370 million and then in the next three-month period, 
3164=    that is April to June 2006, it made sales of over 
3165=    404 million and this again mirrored the massive 
3166=    increases in turnover found in relation to the other -- 
3167=    each of the other contra-traders.
3168=        Their return for the 06/06 period was received on 
3169=    31st July 2006, recording inputs of 393 million and 
3170=    outputs of 404, and the claim was for input tax 
3171=    credit -- sorry the claim for input tax credit 
3172=    substantially offset the output tax payable resulting in 
3173=    a net claim for repayment of just over 8.7 million.
3174=        The deals --
fmt=pb
3175=THE CHAIRMAN:  I am probably being very obtuse here but if 
3176=    there are inputs of 393 million and outputs.  
3177=    404 million why are you in a repayment situation.
3178=MR KINNEAR:  I think because of the different ratings, sir.  
3179=    I would need to go back to the return and look at that 
3180=    precisely.
3181=THE CHAIRMAN:  So some of those outputs 404 are zero rated.
3182=MR KINNEAR:  Yes, that is the reason why.  There were 
3183=    a number of visits between officers of the Revenue and 
3184=    represent I was of Svenson Commodities but the one ^-- 
3185=    correction representatives of reason is come but the at 
3186=    one look at is the one of 15th February 2007 which is at 
3187=    [282/199] there are a number of points within this note.  
3188=    Background info:
3189=        "Mr Koser stated he had been in business for many 
3190=    years in the clothing industry both retail and 
3191=    manufacture, however as more and more manufacturers

3207=    aspects of the business Mr Koser added the accountants 
3208=    were unwilling to provide further services as Svenson 
3209=    was in a trade sector where there was much fraud.
3210=        He continues further down:
3211=        "Are there any associated businesses, yes, fee line,

3218=    the UK, worldwide currently not trading to full capacity 
3219=    main supplier is Svenson UK, majority of

3229=        Again this is a company that doesn't require a penny

3237=    want the phones' Abdul states when company obtained 
3238=    profit he then purchased some stock to keep on hand.  
3239=    States any shortfall in capital is financed by himself 
3240=    personally he takes dividends from his active companies 
3241=    recent which is a flow problems have stem from the fact 
3242=    FCIB has been press iten, after the event, by-the-by,

3245=    does the company have any private investors, no.  How 
3246=    does the company advertise?  Initially the company 
3247=    advertised in trade magazines.  Trader also posts on IPT 
3248=    which is also accessed by trade class.  Company have

3253=        "What market research has been conducted in respect 
3254=    of each type of commodity, not a lot.  The goods Svenson 
3255=    sell are driven by the customer, the customer will call

3257=    call around suppliers to obtain that commodity for the

3267=    knowledge whatsoever in relation to the types of product 
3268=    that is you are dealing in.  We submit that this trader

3283=        "What level -- a question about four questions done:
3284=        "What level of knowledge of product does the sales 
3285=    manager that mat ease stated no real knowledge needed if 
3286=    customer requests a product in the come across before 
3287=    then she will Google place in search engine to find 
3288=    a picture and spec of the model."
3289=        Further down:
3290=        "Are there IMEI scans I'm not sure they are bar code 
3291=    scans of each box is this not an IMEI scan yes I think 
3292=    so but not sure.  So you have IMEI scan reports for 
3293=    Svenson stock to hand I think these are only for one day 
3294=    mobile I'm not sure what stock reports are produced in 
3295=    this temporary principal place of business stock room is 
3296=    one room with separate area for each company."
3297=        If you just give me one second, sir.  There is one 
3298=    other thing I wanted ... could we go back to [282/199] 
3299=    the penultimate question it says who are the current 
fmt=pb
3300=    directors?  (Pause).  Sorry my search function has 
3301=    broken down.  Sorry, I have it, it is in fact page 
3302=    [228/203] ^fg he is asked in the second question down:
3303=        "What is the current financial position of the 
3304=    company?  Abdul states he does not look at current 
3305=    financial position as he is aware that FCIB accounts 
3306=    were causing cash flow problems and not a lot he can do 
3307=    about it.  He also stated he has a market trader 
3308=    mentality and he's aware of the financial situation in 
3309=    his head."
3310=        So it is a 400 million per quarter business run on 
3311=    a market trader mentality with the figures in his head.
3312=        Bundle [375/389] please.  17th June 2009, letter 
3313=    from the Revenue to Svenson, if we go forward to the 
3314=    next page [375/390] we will see about a third of the way 
3315=    down that they were denied 26.7 million worth of input 
3316=    tax relating to the 06/06 period.
3317=        This represented the input tax claimed on their 112 
3318=    broker deals that were carried out during that period.  
3319=    They originally appealed against this decision, but if 
3320=    we turn up, please, [411/492] we will see that original 
3321=    appeal dated 16th July 2009 is subsequently withdrawn.  
3322=    I think the date of this is actually 20th -- at the top, 
3323=    20th July 2011 when the appeal is withdrawn.
3324=THE CHAIRMAN:  So this wasn't a company that went into 
fmt=pb
3325=    liquidation.
3326=MR KINNEAR:  No.  Overview of the trade in the 06/06 period 
3327=    T carried out 313 deals to a value of approximately 
3328=    404 million, the vast majority involving mobile phones 
3329=    and CPUs.  At -- there is a spreadsheet that has 
3330=    an overview of the trade but I'm not going to have it 
3331=    turned up at the moment.  Again, it shows the mark 
3332=    judgments much greater in relation to broker deals as 
3333=    compared to buffer deals.  Again, three distinct types 
3334=    of deals.  112 deals where they purchased from 
3335=    a UK-based trader and sell to an EU-based trader, that 
3336=    is broker deals.  Value -- with a value of 165 # 
3337=    million, input tax of 26-odd million which is later 
3338=    denied as we have seen in the letters.  These deals 
3339=    would have placed Svenson in a very large repayment 
3340=    position.  The deals were predominantly mobile phones, 
3341=    nine involved Intel Pentium CPUs, 15 of the deals traced 
3342=    directly back to two defaulting traders so these are 
3343=    deals, sir, depicted by the yellow line in appendix D.  
3344=    The remaining 97 deals trace back to 8 second line 
3345=    contra-traders, they being Powerstrip, Blackstar, 
3346=    David Jacobs, Export Tech, Digikom, Rioni, Pan Euro and 
3347=    385 north.  Those deals are summarised firstly at 
3348=    [361/139] in relation to May.  So if we look at this 
3349=    diagram there appear to be two almost separate parts to 
fmt=pb
3350=    Svenson's ^-- correction Svenson Commodities' trading on 
3351=    this diagram in May.  On the left-hand side we see very 
3352=    familiar names, we see Mighty Mobile, Adobcom, Starlet, 
3353=    David Jacobs, Powerstrip, Regent, Yalegate, Whitestream, 
3354=    Tojen, and then the European customers, Cayenne, global 
3355=    phone, Intangible and Planetmania but on the right-hand 
3356=    side of the page we see the five of the six traders that 
3357=    in this case act as second line -- purely as second line 
3358=    contra-traders so we see Blackstar, Digikom, 
3359=    Export Tech, Rioni and Pan Euro with similar -- sorry --
3360=THE CHAIRMAN:  Yes I am lost I am afraid.  I can't see 
3361=    Digikom.
3362=MR KINNEAR:  Blackstar, Digikom, Export Tech, Rioni and 
3363=    Pan Euro.
3364=THE CHAIRMAN:  Yes.
3365=MR KINNEAR:  And then into three buffers.
3366=A.  Greystone Nobel and trade 24 to Svenson and then the 
3367=    goods from that side of the diagram sold to a separate 
3368=    set of European customers so there is -- you could 
3369=    almost -- draw a line down the middle of that page and 
3370=    almost have two what -- what appear to be two separate 
3371=    sells or schemes but feeding through Svenson but the 
3372=    same pattern, EU supplies UK importer, buffer, Svenson 
3373=    is the broker, back out to the EU again.
3374=        The June deals then, summarised in [361/143] and we 
fmt=pb
3375=    see this time four of the second line contra-traders, 
3376=    Pan Euro, 385 North, Export Tech and Digikom, and they 
3377=    sell either directly to Svenson or through the buffer 
3378=    Greystone.  The goods coming in from the EU but then 
3379=    going back through Svenson back out to the EU again.
3380=        Second set of transactions carried out by Svenson 
3381=    are --
3382=THE CHAIRMAN:  Sorry, this chart you have here, is this 
3383=    a yellow line as per appendix D?
3384=MR KINNEAR:  Yes.  These --
3385=THE CHAIRMAN:  Which is --
3386=MR KINNEAR:  No sorry --
3387=THE CHAIRMAN:  There isn't a defaulter though.
3388=MR KINNEAR:  These ones, sir, are blue line on appendix D.
3389=THE CHAIRMAN:  Was the last chart a blue line.
3390=MR KINNEAR:  It was a blue line on appendix D as well, sir, 
3391=    yes.
3392=THE CHAIRMAN:  There isn't a defaulter in that.
3393=MR KINNEAR:  No, so in relation to Svenson, sir, 112 deals 
3394=    where they purchase from a UK-based trader and in the 
3395=    break down 15 of the deals are effectively yellow line 
3396=    deals, of 112, 15 are yellow line deals and 97 are blue 
3397=    line deals.  Then the next set of transactions are 76 
3398=    deals where they purchase from EU-based suppliers, so we 
3399=    are talking now about green line, 76 green line 
fmt=pb
3400=    transactions, where they have purchased from 
3401=    Mighty Mobile, Mountainrix, Forex, Starlet Adobcom and 
3402=    Pol Comm and they sell to UK-based customers.  They are 
3403=    what we are terming acquisition deals with a value of 
3404=    103 million.
3405=        These deals or the goods were eventually exported 
3406=    back to the EU, Megantic acted as the broker exporter in 
3407=    many of these deals and as a buffer in one other.  The 
3408=    goods are always mobile phones, and summary diagrams can 
3409=    be found first of all [361/135]
3410=THE CHAIRMAN:  Again no default nevertheless these.
3411=MR KINNEAR:  No defaulters, these, sir, are green line deals 
3412=    so Svenson acting as the acquirer from the now familiar 
3413=    EU entities, through again a very similar group of 
3414=    buffers, we see Evenmore, Wildberry again, and then 
3415=    through to five -- this is in relation to April, five 
3416=    brokers, region end, Megantic, David Jacobs, 
3417=    Rapid Global, BT S and then again a very similar list of 
3418=    European comes.  The May transactions summarised at 
3419=    [361/137] and again not much comment I would submit 
3420=    required on this at this stage other than to say "more 
3421=    of the same" in May.
3422=        Then for June at page [361/141] again you will 
3423=    recall in relation to each of the other contra-traders 
3424=    when we get to June there are only two European 
fmt=pb
3425=    suppliers Adobcom and Mighty Mobile to Svenson, similar 
3426=    group of buffers including Megantic, and then a group of 
3427=    three brokers, Megantic, Rapid global, Base Interactive 
3428=    all selling to a fixed group of European customers.
3429=        So those are effectively the green line deals and 
3430=    then on top of those two types of import and export 
3431=    deals, acquisition and dispatch deals, they also acted 
3432=    as a buffer in 125 deals buying from the UK and selling 
3433=    to the UK, the value of those sales was just shy of 
3434=    137 million.  118 deals mobile phones, 7 CPUs, and 86 of 
3435=    those deals, those that have been traced, 86 of these 
3436=    have been traced back to one of a number of -- quite 
3437=    a large number of defaulting traders which are listed at 
3438=    paragraph 30, subparagraph (c).
3439=        Like all the other contra-traders, 
3440=    Svenson Commodities would never purchase from an EU 
3441=    supplier and sell to an EU customer.  Purchase from an E 
3442=    ultimate supplier would always involve a sale to the UK 
3443=    and a sale to a EU customer was always the product of 
3444=    a UK purchase, a point I have already made.  The trade 
3445=    was conducted in this manner because it was the only way 
3446=    to make good the fraud.
3447=        I have a footnote in paragraph 31 that effectively 
3448=    this is certainly one of the occasion where is it is 
3449=    worth reading the statements in relation to all of 
fmt=pb
3450=    these, in particular in relation to this one, officer 
3451=    Williams halls provided considerable detail in relation 
3452=    to crossovers and patterns which exist.
3453=THE CHAIRMAN:  Is that accepted to be included, that 
3454=    evidence?
3455=MR PATCHETT-JOYCE:  No, sir, because that is back to the 
3456=    Hywel Owen --
3457=THE CHAIRMAN:  That is what I was wondering.  Perhaps you 
3458=    just need to clarify that.
3459=MR KINNEAR:  At some stage I am presume building 
3460=    Patchett-Joyce and/or those who instruct him are going 
3461=    to provide with us a document which sets out the 
3462=    objection that is they take it these witness statements.
3463=MR PATCHETT-JOYCE:  It is very simple, sir.  There was 
3464=    an order for substitution which resulted in the 2012 
3465=    evidence and we say that it goes way beyond that.  Now, 
3466=    we may have to make a formal application, it may have to 
3467=    be adjudicated caitd ^-- correction adjudicated upon but 
3468=    that is the ambit --
3469=THE CHAIRMAN:  But my recollection of the interlocutory 
3470=    hearing that I heard with Judge Berner was that you 
3471=    accepted that there was something in Mr Patchett-Joyce's 
3472=    points and that you were going to get together to agree 
3473=    the parts of this evidence which was to be excluded.
3474=MR KINNEAR:  That was relation sir to the statements of 
fmt=pb
3475=    Mr Downer and Mr Humphries and in relation to these 
3476=    statements we provided Mr Patchett-Joyce with statements 
3477=    from which we redacted some parts of the statements and 
3478=    in fact they appear within the system now as redacted.  
3479=    We will continue to discuss this, but at some stage --
3480=THE CHAIRMAN:  Was it different with Mr Williams?
3481=MR KINNEAR:  Mr Williams wasn't mentioned that 
3482=    the interlocutory hearing.
3483=THE CHAIRMAN:  I do remember the point being taken about 
3484=    replacement officers.
3485=MR PATCHETT-JOYCE:  Sir, your recollection is right, and to 
3486=    be fair to informed may be that Mr Williams wasn't 
3487=    mentioned by name.  But what I did say, and we can look 
3488=    at the transcript and I'm sure it will be there, but 
3489=    what I said was that in relation to the 2012 evidence 
3490=    there was an issue and we said that the 2012 evidence as 
3491=    long as it -- you will recall sir for the --
3492=THE CHAIRMAN:  I remember the point and I thought that it 
3493=    was resolved by Mr Kinnear accepting that --
3494=MR KINNEAR:  That was on a different point.  In fact I have 
3495=    a different recollection, I recall Judge Berner saying 
3496=    something to the effect it is very difficult for someone 
3497=    who is writing a replacement statement in the it rely on 
3498=    material they have in opinion from of them but we can 
3499=    look at the transcript.
fmt=pb
3500=MR PATCHETT-JOYCE:  We will have to look at that, sir what 
3501=    I said was that if witnesses who are simply stepping 
3502=    into the shoes of a previous witness, the simple and 
3503=    clear way of dealing with it is just to adopt, just to 
3504=    adopt the previous witness statement.
3505=THE CHAIRMAN:  But the point was wasn't it that 
3506=    the direction that is permitted this replacement 
3507=    evidence permitted it as replacement evidence.  
3508=    Am I wrong there.
3509=MR KINNEAR:  Permitted replacement evidence.
3510=THE CHAIRMAN:  Replacement evidence is replacement evidence 
3511=    it is not replacement evidence with stuff added on ^chk.
3512=MR KINNEAR:  If and when we have this argument I will take 
3513=    everyone to the actual wording of the direction, and 
3514=    great care was taken in relation to these statements but 
3515=    we --
3516=THE CHAIRMAN:  I don't want it create a problem if there 
3517=    isn't one but I apprehend there may be a problem or at 
3518=    any rate cross wires and I asked the parties 
3519=    representatives try and sort that out.
3520=        Is this a good place to stop.
3521=MR KINNEAR:  As good as any sir.
3522=THE CHAIRMAN:  So we will pick it up at --
3523=MR KINNEAR:  I will finish off Svenson Commodities in the 
3524=    morning.
fmt=pb
3525=THE CHAIRMAN:  Thank you very much.  How are we doing on 
3526=    time.
3527=MR KINNEAR:  I think I'm going to be -- I think I budgeted 
3528=    for if you are days and I think I am going to be four 
3529=    days.
3530=THE CHAIRMAN:  That is to the end of the week.
3531=MR KINNEAR:  To the end of the week, yes.
3532=THE CHAIRMAN:  All right.  10.30 am tomorrow.
